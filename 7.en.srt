(Incoming call)

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.539
It was quite a shock to get a phone call from the police...

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:34.869
in the morning, wasn't it?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.909
Nonetheless, we should still meet.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.310
Come to the parking lot.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.549
I should have figured out...

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.060
that you were behind this...

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:52.560
when those punks caused this kind of trouble.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.030
I let my guard down.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.929
Come on. You managed to win over the guys from the Dongsoo Gang too.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.170
So they're your uncles. Right?

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.170
But this is too bad. I don't need your uncles anymore.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.969
I plan to get things done my way.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:08.609
So it suits my style.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.060
We filed a complaint against him like you told us to do.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.730
We deleted all the videos from social media.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.430
Some kids saw us when he beat us up. So we talked them into...

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.599
becoming our witnesses.

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:34.769
What about our reward?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.269
Awesome.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.180
Hey, what are you doing? We're in front of a police station.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.680
Song Yi Heon's family is loaded.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.349
I'm certain he's going to challenge us on this.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.579
You will get us a lawyer, right?

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.790
Right. You'll get us jobs too.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.890
Have you been fooled all your life?

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:58.620
Why are you guys so suspicious of everything?

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.390
Come here.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:02.790
Don't worry.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.260
As long as you help me send him to a juvenile detention centre,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.469
I'll be taking care of you guys for life.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.270
- Gosh. - Nice.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.400
Thank you!

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.310
- Let's go. - Nice.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.979
Giving drugs to my mother wasn't enough?

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.409
How could you do something like this?

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.479
Drugs?

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.580
Me?

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.879
Oh, my. You should double-check on that.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.620
Are you sure I gave her the drugs?

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.689
The record must say that she got them prescribed herself.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.860
Oh, my.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.360
You're scaring me.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.770
Even if you're angry, you should try to hold back...

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.469
because I didn't come here alone.

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.509
You won't be able to catch me.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.419
You can try all you want,

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.250
but you must have realized that you can't beat me. So decide.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.490
Will you go abroad to study? Or will you go to juvie?

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.650
I see.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:06.930
You tried to abduct my mother, but you failed.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.629
So you want to get rid of me first?

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.460
It doesn't matter if I go abroad or juvie.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.669
My mother will be sent to a psychiatric institution.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.099
Once his wife passes away and my mother is in a hospital,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.340
you must think you will become his next wife.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.069
Have you heard of this saying?

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.539
"If you try to filter out makgeolli, you'll even lose the dregs."

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.539
It means trying to score big...

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.050
can backfire and cause you to suffer a loss.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:29.810
Enough is enough.

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.620
I want you to stop meddling in my life.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.520
Go and tell your homeroom teacher that you're going abroad to study.

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.789
If you don't do that, you'll end up in juvie.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.889
Then you'll never be able to find your mother. Why?

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.800
Because I'll lock her up in a place that's not even listed on the map.

(Episode 7)

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.789
I'm going to school.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.090
Have the driver drop you off at school starting today.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.030
Try to adjust to the changes at school.

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.129
These changes are taking you to the right direction.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.100
So stop acting out.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.480
It's the student government president.

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:37.279
He came to school today.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.949
Right. I wonder if he's okay.

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:45.189
You're in my class as of today.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.959
- What? - You got separated...

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:49.990
from Song Yi Heon.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.000
You asked the school to do that...

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.360
because a victim and a school bully shouldn't be in the same class.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.600
So you were moved to my class.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.370
What are you talking about? The school bully?

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.870
The principal, the school violence committee,

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.870
and the parents' association...

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.040
decided on that before the weekend.

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:05.980
Song Yi Heon was called by the school violence committee.

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.470
The person you have reached is unavailable.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.939
You'll be directed to voicemail after the tone.

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.370
You will be charged then.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.899
- He's here. - Hey.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.540
Ice Cream is dead. How?

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.079
Did it freeze to death?

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:17.350
The more you eat this, the colder you get. What is this dish?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.980
Chili?

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.420
What kind of bread can you wear across your body?

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:22.689
- Bag-it... Baguette. - Correct.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.060
You pass.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.860
Are you all right?

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.660
You must feel uncomfortable too.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.029
You don't have to force yourselves to act like my friends.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.430
Gosh.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.329
Now that Se Kyung isn't here, you must be nicer to us...

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:38.540
because I'll be helping you study math.

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:40.769
I might not be as smart as Se Kyung,

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:42.610
but I got a Grade One for math.

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:44.040
I'll help you study Korean and science.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.649
I'll go to the snack bar with you.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.680
It was my idea to buy all this.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:53.850
Respect.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.120
Nice.

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:56.750
Thank you.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.620
How could you be called by the school violence committee?

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:00.459
If they had known how close you guys were,

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:01.629
they would've never done that.

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:02.730
Exactly.

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:05.629
When I saw Se Kyung smile while hanging out with you,

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.970
it made me wonder if he was the same Se Kyung I knew.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.600
For some reason, something about him sparkled.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.740
Like that?

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.149
I heard you moved to Class One. Did I hear wrong?

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.180
As for the school violence committee,

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.680
the adults must've gotten the wrong idea.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.449
I already told the principal.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.819
Everything will go away soon. So don't treat us differently.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.160
- Have you been well? - Yes.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.129
What about you?

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:37.459
Hey, student government president.

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:39.959
You look especially handsome today.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.170
- Come on. - Right.

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:42.970
There's no way Yi Heon hit Se Kyung.

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:45.199
Yi Heon. I never doubted you.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.670
Hey. What do you mean, the hearing will go away?

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:51.740
I can fill out a form to request to cancel the hearing.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.680
The victim and the guardian have to sign the form. That's it.

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:55.980
I doubt your father will do that.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.879
Don't worry. This happened because of me.

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:01.519
I want to fix it.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.990
You're all grown up now.

00:08:08.329 --> 00:08:09.389
You!

00:08:09.829 --> 00:08:11.829
I heard Byung Chul and Duk Jun reported you for school violence.

00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:12.899
- What? - What?

00:08:13.529 --> 00:08:15.029
- They reported him? - What?

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.600
- Yi Heon did what? - Yi Heon did that?

00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:18.399
- What did he do? - What?

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.569
Apparently, I beat them up.

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:23.139
You must have beaten them up badly if they reported you to the police.

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:25.579
Gosh. You're so dense. Do you think he really did that?

00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:27.009
If he didn't, why did they report him?

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:28.250
I don't know why.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.379
They bullied Yi Heon. But they reported Yi Heon.

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:32.779
They're probably trying to make him the school bully...

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:34.389
when he's the victim by beating him to the punch.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.490
They're trying to send me to juvie. That's why.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:39.460
There's a woman named Lee Mi Kyung.

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:41.830
She's the one who ordered the gang to abduct my mother.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:45.059
She sweet-talked them into reporting me to the police.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.970
But where did you hear the news?

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.039
Well, I happened to overhear it...

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.470
on my way to school.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.539
So those jerks won't be coming to school today.

00:08:57.809 --> 00:09:01.679
Do you now realize you had been hanging out with such dirtbags?

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:04.179
Darn it. Why are you taking it out on me again?

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:05.580
You, maybes sicko.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.649
What's "maybes?"

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:10.049
Hey, if someone bites you,

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.120
you can report him for assault, right?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.090
Yes, probably.

00:09:14.129 --> 00:09:16.059
Hey, do you have proof?

00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:18.929
Even if I have to search all the hidden cameras in that area,

00:09:18.929 --> 00:09:20.259
I'll find the video for proof.

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.399
Hidden cameras?

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.370
- You must mean security cameras. - Tomato tomahto!

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:25.970
Hey, stop fighting.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.039
So tell me. Where are Byung Chul and Duk Jun now?

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.110
They're probably idling away at the billiard club around school.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.809
I'll be back.

00:09:34.809 --> 00:09:36.649
What? Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.850
The class found out that they reported you.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.350
So the whole school must know about it by now.

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:43.820
I've done nothing wrong. Why should I be worried?

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.120
Wait. Am I responsible for making everyone find out about this?

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:49.190
Because of what I said out loud earlier?

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.360
Even if you didn't say anything,

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:52.899
they were bound to find out once the police came to school.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:56.769
Get back inside.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.899
The study hall will start soon.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.909
Right? I have nothing to worry about. Right?

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.110
You still don't understand...

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.320
that you caused everything that's happening now. Right?

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.960
What do you mean? Why is this my fault?

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.620
Ask your best friends.

00:10:20.059 --> 00:10:21.690
They know exactly...

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:23.690
what you've done.

00:10:26.529 --> 00:10:27.570
I know that...

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.500
you're not behind the recent turn of events.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.039
I feel bad that you're being used as disposable pawns...

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:34.039
in this mess, created by adults.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.809
So let me give you one last chance.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.210
Withdraw your complaint and come back to school now.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.980
Then I won't take issue with this.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.980
You need a high school diploma to have a decent life.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.019
This is your last chance.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.990
What? You did beat us up.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.960
If you don't drop the charges,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.299
I'll report you to the police too.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.429
Then we'll find out who the real school bully is.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.600
"Kihojise."

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.639
(A metaphor to describe a situation when one cannot stop one's pursuit)

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:08.269
I'll take charge as if I were galloping on a tiger.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.639
And once I bite, I won't let go.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.379
If you're curious, take this matter to the end and see.

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:18.850
- That jerk. - No way.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.389
- Gallop? - Guys.

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:25.789
Do you think you can give up the money?

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.960
Are you out of your mind?

00:11:27.289 --> 00:11:29.460
We haven't had a big score like this in a while. How can we give it up?

00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:33.259
Then let's get Hong Jae Min to report him to the police too.

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:34.299
What?

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.929
The kids we beat up will never testify against us...

00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:37.799
because they're scared of us.

00:11:38.169 --> 00:11:40.269
We never bullied him in the classroom.

00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:43.840
So the only person who knows exactly how we bullied Song Yi Heon...

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.940
is Hong Jae Min.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:47.179
You're right.

00:11:47.179 --> 00:11:48.980
There are no videos or witnesses.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.350
Even if Song Yi Heon says that we bullied him,

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.350
there's no evidence.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.350
We just have to get Hong Jae Min on our side. That's it.

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:56.419
Yes.

00:11:56.419 --> 00:11:57.419
Hey, call him now.

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:01.929
Hey. If you do this, you might end up in big trouble.

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:03.159
Haven't you heard of colony?

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.230
If you try to frame an innocent person...

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.899
for a crime they didn't commit,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.399
you'll be arrested for colony.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.500
Well, isn't it "calumny?"

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.940
Anyway, if you trust that lady...

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.340
and try to send Song Yi Heon to juvie,

00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:17.309
you might end up getting in trouble.

00:12:17.309 --> 00:12:19.039
Hey, we have nothing to lose.

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:20.509
I don't know when it will be,

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:21.710
but when he reports us for school violence,

00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:23.879
we must prepare to fight back.

00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:25.919
And that lady will help us do that.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.519
Hey, she'll get us a lawyer too.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.419
When we graduate, we'll get us jobs too.

00:12:31.659 --> 00:12:34.659
Gosh. That lady sounds scary.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.529
But to report him...

00:12:38.059 --> 00:12:40.059
for school violence, don't you need a medical note?

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.029
It's been ages since he hit you.

00:12:43.669 --> 00:12:45.970
Besides, you hit him too.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.669
We already got the medical note...

00:12:47.669 --> 00:12:49.309
when you beat us up a while ago.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.710
- What? - Hey. If you didn't beat us up,

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.710
we probably had to punch each other.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.980
Hey, that's not right.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.279
How could you use that to report him?

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.580
That's fraud.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.419
I get that you guys love money.

00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:02.820
But don't you have a conscience, you tricksters?

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.690
Gosh. Talk about having double standards, Jae Min.

00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:09.129
You were the one who started bullying him for money.

00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:10.730
You were the one who made him bring alcohol...

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.600
because his family seemed rich.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.230
You made him bring jewellery from his house too.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.730
When Song Yi Heon got scared and indeed brought the jewellery,

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.840
you were over the moon.

00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:21.909
Don't you think we'll at least get 5,000 dollars?

00:13:21.909 --> 00:13:23.370
No way. That's too much.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.779
Hey. If we get 5,000 dollars, the 5 of us can...

00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:28.210
- We're getting 3,000 dollars? - He signalled 3,000 dollars.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.509
- If we're getting 3,000 dollars... - Hey, let's divide that by...

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:31.679
Gosh.

00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:32.720
This is cool.

00:13:35.049 --> 00:13:37.960
- Come here. - Hey. Over here.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.019
When he told you he didn't have any more stuff to bring,

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.159
you slapped him and told him to steal some.

00:13:42.929 --> 00:13:44.730
That's when we started to beat him up.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.399
We locked him up, threw milk at him,

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:49.330
singed him. We even made him strip.

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:51.639
If I were him, I would've committed suicide a long time ago.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.210
You bullied him for two years. How could you not remember that?

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:57.679
Exactly. If you make this mistake again,

00:13:57.679 --> 00:13:59.340
you'll be the school bully. Got it?

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.450
Don't even think about testifying or anything like that.

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:03.850
If you do, you'll end up going to juvie.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.320
Besides, when he reports us, your name is bound to come up.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.519
Do you think he won't name you because you didn't report him?

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.850
You started this whole thing.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.259
We must beat him to the punch before he gets a chance.

00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:16.330
Let's report him together.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.830
We have the upper hand.

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:24.840
Wait.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.639
This case is unfavourable to me?

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.370
Yes. They said they had witnesses who saw you beat up...

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.210
Jang Byung Chul and Park Duk Jun near the garbage incinerator.

00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:37.350
Detective, I'm the victim.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.679
So you're telling me you're the victim,

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:40.679
not the school bully?

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:45.659
They told me that you've been bullying them...

00:14:45.659 --> 00:14:47.159
since the first semester of your senior year.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.559
Song Yi Heon...

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.200
I mean, I've been bullied...

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.169
by them ever since I started high school.

00:14:55.299 --> 00:14:57.399
I even have a journal where I recorded how they bullied me.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.110
I can find videos of them bullying me on an online forum too.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.440

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.250
They must have deleted all the videos.

00:15:18.019 --> 00:15:19.360
The videos were definitely on here.

Gosh. Seriously.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.429
So your mother is in the hospital.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.299
And you can't get in touch with your father.

Gosh. Let's stop here for today.

00:15:33.139 --> 00:15:34.200
Bring the journal...

00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:36.340
where you wrote down how they bullied you...

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.409
or videos you just mentioned at the next questioning.

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:40.740
Just bring anything that could be used as evidence.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.279
And if you can find a friend who can testify...

00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:45.820
that you were bullied at school,

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.320
bring that friend no matter what.

00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:50.320
That way, you can only prove that you're not the school bully.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.820
Yes, sir.

00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:06.669
Shouldn't you be studying at school?

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.409
Should you skip school like this?

00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:10.070
I shouldn't.

00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:14.039
But I can only focus on my studies once I handle this matter.

Lee Mi Kyung got my classmates to report me for school violence.

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:20.919
She's going to send me to juvie.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.620
What? Juvie? Isn't that the same as the slammer?

00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:26.419
Gosh. Is she out of her mind?

00:16:26.559 --> 00:16:27.620
Don't tell me you've been using...

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.559
the skills your father taught you to beat up other kids.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.159
Did you beat them to a pulp?

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.929
No, I got beaten up.

00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:36.500
Who is this jerk that beat you up?

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.799
How dare he come after my dear nephew?

Let's go.

But I ended up getting framed as the school bully.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.779
I was called by the school violence committee too.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.580
- Then... - What...

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:54.990
What is this about?

00:16:55.649 --> 00:16:57.049
They're claiming that I beat them up.

00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:58.389
What?

00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:02.659
Gosh.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.500
I talked to my classmates, so they would come to their senses.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:09.930
If they still don't withdraw their complaint,

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.940
we must get Lee Mi Kyung, so she makes them drop the charges.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.839
Besides, we must get Lee Mi Kyung no matter what...

00:17:17.779 --> 00:17:19.109
because there's no guarantee...

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:21.180
that she won't try to come after my mom again.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.950
I told her to go to you and beg for your forgiveness.

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:26.549
But that's what she had been up to.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.819
By the way, what do you plan to do after getting Lee Mi Kyung?

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.559
I'll make her face Chairman Bae first.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.559
That woman is someone who wants Chairman Bae's money, power,

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.799
and even his heart.

00:17:41.099 --> 00:17:44.670
So if she gets out of his shadow, she will lose everything.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.799
I'm going to bring her in front of Chairman Bae...

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.869
to reveal everything and have her completely thrown out.

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:54.950
So that she may never approach Mother and Song Yi Heon.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.579
We will bring her no matter what. Don't worry.

00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:00.150
Then I will trust you...

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.450
and care for Mother...

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.759
while focusing on midterms.

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:08.130
"Midterms?"

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.329
This test...

00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:12.829
will be the first test to be reflected in his records.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.140
It's the test that decides whether he can go to college or not.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.240
So whether I end up in juvenile hall or not,

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.109
and whether I go to college or not both depend on you.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.609
- Please do your best. - Yes, Boss.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:35.720
- Good luck. - Yes, sir.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.289
Take care, Boss.

00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:57.369
I heard you were fired from the hair salon.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.309
Where are you going, when you have no place to sleep?

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:01.910
I wasn't fired, I just quit.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.819
And what would I do here? It doesn't even feel like home.

00:19:04.819 --> 00:19:06.119
Why, you...

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.390
If it's not home, then what is it?

00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:10.190
You don't even come home often,

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.759
so why are you going nuts?

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:13.089
What did you call me?

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.589
And "nuts"? To your brother?

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.460
I already have a headache. Why are you acting out as well?

00:19:21.329 --> 00:19:22.369
Dad said to give this to you.

00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:23.569
(Prepare For Tomorrow Savings Account Bankbook)

00:19:28.269 --> 00:19:29.410
They cut off the water.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:31.339
How is this a home when you can't even shower?

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.880
What did you just say?

00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:34.549
Come here, you. Hey!

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.250
That little...

00:19:43.289 --> 00:19:45.990
Don't even think about testifying or anything like that.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.519
If you do, you'll end up going to juvie.

00:19:48.089 --> 00:19:50.890
Crazy. Why would I go to juvie?

00:19:52.529 --> 00:19:53.829
Whatever.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.339
Lawsuit or testifying, I'm going to ignore it all.

00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:02.240
Besides, when he reports us, your name is bound to come up.

00:20:02.339 --> 00:20:03.609
Do you think he won't name you...

00:20:03.609 --> 00:20:04.710
because you didn't report him?

00:20:05.279 --> 00:20:06.410
You started this whole thing.

00:20:12.319 --> 00:20:14.480
He won't say my name during the investigation, will he?

00:20:16.289 --> 00:20:17.890
Should I ask him not to say it?

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:25.400
(Prepare For Tomorrow Savings Account Bankbook)

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.619
I can somehow manage to solve probability problems.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.390
But I really can't understand functions.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.430
Watch.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.559
For this problem...

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.269
You got it wrong here.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.269
You have to substitute it here.

00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:09.740
Do you mean I could be a substitute teacher?

00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:13.609
I'm not even done with these problems.

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:16.950
No, you need to substitute this, not the other one.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.150
They cancelled the school violence committee.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:22.720
I saw it.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.589
Did your father sign the cancellation request?

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.660
You have a lot of problems on your hands,

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.130
with the lawsuit and your mother.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.059
I wanted to handle at least the committee for you.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.970
Are you sure it wasn't because you wanted to make me study...

00:21:38.299 --> 00:21:40.869
so that you can see Song Yi Heon earlier?

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:43.910
There's also that, but...

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.609
I didn't want to lose a friend.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.220
You're the only real friend I have.

00:21:53.819 --> 00:21:55.890
So you can't ever go to juvie.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:58.490
Fine.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.490
Make sure to say the same even when Song Yi Heon returns.

00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:03.589
That you're friends.

00:22:18.779 --> 00:22:20.940
I'm sure I told you that I won't wait for long.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.680
(I'm sure I told you that I won't wait for long. Yi Heon)

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.750
I'm sure you heard that we have an advantage.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.420
We decided not to drop it.

00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:28.789
Was it, "I'll take charge as if I were galloping on a tiger?"

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.759
We will charge like that as well, so let's take this until the end.

00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:34.960
They will only come to their senses once they fall off the tiger.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.759
Those unethical kids...

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.329
(Jong Cheol)

00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:48.970
This is best for waking up.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:51.839
Boss Chil Sung showed up.

00:22:52.339 --> 00:22:54.779
He met the retired bosses at an inn in Gangneung...

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.750
and said that he would visit soon after asking about us.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:00.680
It's a relief to hear that...

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:03.420
he's doing well.

00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:06.589
He heard about his nephew, so he will be here soon.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.589
What about Chairman Bae and Lee Mi Kyung?

00:23:11.089 --> 00:23:12.529
We kept an eye on them these past few days,

00:23:13.099 --> 00:23:15.730
but there's no sign of Lee Mi Kyung and Chairman Bae at the office.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.299
It seems like...

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.970
the appellants have no intentions of dropping it.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.910
Then if we don't find Lee Mi Kyung, will you become the assailant?

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.980
We will do whatever it takes to find where Lee Mi Kyung is.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.049
You can't ever go to juvie.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.950
Right.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.420
It may be hard, but you just focus on your exams.

00:23:41.289 --> 00:23:42.359
Good luck.

00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:49.329
Number 16, 5. Number 17, 1.

00:23:53.539 --> 00:23:54.809
Number 18, 1.

00:23:56.339 --> 00:23:57.869
Number 19, 4.

00:23:58.539 --> 00:23:59.940
Number 20, 5.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.410
That's it.

00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:04.819
You got everything on the last page, Song Yi Heon?

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.450
- What? - Goodness.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.390
- Really? - The questions were really hard.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.589
- Amazing. - Gosh.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.630
President, we're done marking them, right?

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.130
What? Yes.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.529
Take your phones, and we don't have an assembly today,

00:24:19.799 --> 00:24:21.400
so you can all go home except for those on cleaning duty.

00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:22.799
Good job on your exams.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240
Here.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.339
Go on and tell him.

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:35.680
(Detective Min, The case has been sent to the prosecution.)

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.079
(And your father is abroad at the moment.)

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.519
Gosh...

00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:43.789
Yi Heon.

00:24:44.619 --> 00:24:45.960
Do you want to go and have tteokbokki with me?

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.960
Sorry, I have to go somewhere today.

00:24:58.069 --> 00:24:59.069
Yi Heon.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.309
What? You go to my school?

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.809
What are you doing, since exams are over?

00:25:08.849 --> 00:25:10.150
I have something to tell you.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.349
Do you want to go and eat tteokbokki?

00:25:14.619 --> 00:25:16.549
Sorry, there's something I have to do.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.420
Instead, I will buy tteokbokki and tea next time.

00:25:19.759 --> 00:25:20.920
What do you say we talk then?

00:25:21.359 --> 00:25:23.029
Okay. For sure.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:26.900
She's...

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.769
Hey...

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.869
Song Yi Heon! What was that?

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.970
Why would Choi Seol Hee eat tteokbokki with you?

00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:35.410
What will you talk about?

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.079
- How do you know him? - Choi Seol Hee.

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:42.349
She wins medals at the National Sports Festival,

00:25:42.349 --> 00:25:43.549
and she's on the archery national team.

00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:44.779
She's so famous.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.349
Are you having a fling with Choi Seol Hee?

00:25:47.619 --> 00:25:49.349
No, it's not like that.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:52.490
I just saw her a few times at the study room. That's all.

00:25:54.259 --> 00:25:56.190
Is she prettier, or am I?

00:25:56.759 --> 00:25:57.759
What?

00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:02.130
Both of you are pretty, of course.

00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:05.539
But maybe it's because Seol Hee has a small face,

00:26:05.539 --> 00:26:06.670
she seems to have good proportions.

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:08.609
So you're saying...

00:26:09.509 --> 00:26:10.869
I have a big face?

00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:13.339
No, I...

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.279
"You don't have a big face."

00:26:16.349 --> 00:26:18.549
No, I don't like small faces.

00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:21.049
You have to have a big face...

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:23.990
to have big eyes, nose, and mouth, which looks cool.

00:26:24.089 --> 00:26:26.190
So you're saying my face is big.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.859
No, I mean...

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.160
Your face isn't big.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.029
It's just that Seol Hee has an exceptionally small face.

00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:34.230
You're so annoying!

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.430
Min Ji!

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:39.369
You don't know anything about women.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.470
Hey, Nam Min Ji!

00:26:43.369 --> 00:26:45.640
Why is it even more difficult...

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.980
to figure out ladies' hearts than solving problems?

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.579
Do you also have something with Min Ji?

00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:51.079
Are you two-timing them?

00:26:51.079 --> 00:26:53.779
No. I have something important, so I should go.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.990
Where are you going? You need to follow Nam Min Ji.

00:26:56.289 --> 00:26:58.490
You can't go like that even if you don't know women!

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.059
You'll ruin your school life!

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.220
Hey!

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.029
For cases involving minors, we contact the guardians first.

00:27:06.099 --> 00:27:09.529
But OK Construction won't give us Chairman Bae's personal number,

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.130
he won't go to work at all,

00:27:11.299 --> 00:27:13.269
and it didn't seem like he was at home,

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.470
so we checked just in case,

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.910
and we found a departure record.

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:18.410
But...

00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:22.150
How did this get turned over to the prosecution so quickly?

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:23.880
I'm baffled as well.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.079
The prosecution suddenly contacted us in the morning,

00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:27.549
saying they will handle it quickly.

00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:31.150
They said they would investigate as soon as possible,

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.019
so you should better prepare in advance.

00:27:33.019 --> 00:27:35.630
The assailant and victim's claims are completely different,

00:27:35.859 --> 00:27:38.029
so the investigation will be a three-party encounter.

00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:46.940
(Your criminal mediation schedule will be held on May 8, 2023.)

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.200
(Please attend at the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.)

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:49.470
It says...

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.480
to come next Monday.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.710
It's right after this weekend?

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.349
There are many victims,

00:27:59.349 --> 00:28:01.079
and the violence is quite severe,

00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:03.250
but it isn't something to be processed this quickly.

00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:04.849
If this goes on,

00:28:05.519 --> 00:28:08.460
then the assailant will be taken in right after the investigation.

00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:11.630
Then if I become the assailant,

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.900
I guess I won't be able to attend school.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.970
I think someone who is very interested in this case...

00:28:18.599 --> 00:28:20.539
is influencing the prosecution.

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:24.910
(School Violence Committee Cancellation Request, Guardian)

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.579
My Se Kyung turned this in?

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:28.910
Yes.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.849
Still, how can you cancel it without additional confirmation?

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.789
Who would trust the school to handle work?

00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:37.849
Sir...

00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:40.859
Don't get too upset.

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:42.190
Ma'am, what do I do with the extra...

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:52.339
Did you turn in the cancellation form?

00:28:52.839 --> 00:28:53.970
After getting it signed by your mother?

00:28:54.539 --> 00:28:56.440
I didn't think you would do it.

00:29:00.809 --> 00:29:02.880
Regarding Song Yi Heon's charges for school violence,

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.079
I told them to hand it over to the prosecutor's office.

00:29:07.049 --> 00:29:09.049
What do you mean?

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:10.990
I already told the local precinct.

00:29:11.589 --> 00:29:13.759
I told them to tell me first...

00:29:14.089 --> 00:29:15.329
if they receive any case related to Song Yi Heon.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.859
When I heard that the meeting was cancelled,

00:29:20.329 --> 00:29:21.329
I handed it over.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.500
Yi Heon didn't do that.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.740
- Yi Heon is the victim. - Wake up!

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.910
I can't even handle the fact that he coaxed my son...

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.039
and led him astray,

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.680
but he's the kind that cancels the meeting behind my back...

00:29:32.839 --> 00:29:34.940
and says for himself that he's a gangster,

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.750
and he's a scum that hits other kids.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.880
If the school can't, he should be punished through legislation.

00:29:41.019 --> 00:29:43.920
I'll do everything I can to send him to juvie...

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.859
as soon as possible,

00:29:45.859 --> 00:29:47.960
so that he may never set foot in school again.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.359
Watch what you say, please.

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:53.500
I'm the one who cancelled the meeting.

00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:57.029
Because I'm not a victim.

00:29:59.069 --> 00:30:00.099
Are you...

00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:04.069
even the Se Kyung I know?

00:30:04.539 --> 00:30:06.279
I'm doing my best...

00:30:06.279 --> 00:30:08.480
to raise you properly.

00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:12.650
Why are you breaking down like this?

00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:14.579
Are you by any chance...

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:16.920
thinking about testifying?

00:30:17.349 --> 00:30:18.589
If you do testify,

00:30:18.589 --> 00:30:20.089
don't think of ever seeing me again.

00:30:20.089 --> 00:30:21.660
You won't be my son.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:25.829
(Hello. This is the Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office.)

00:30:25.829 --> 00:30:27.000
(Your criminal mediation schedule will be held on May 8, 2023.)

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
(Please attend at the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.)

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.869
It's not Lee Mi Kyung.

00:30:40.309 --> 00:30:43.410
If it was Lee Mi Kyung, she would have already reported it.

00:30:43.809 --> 00:30:45.480
She wouldn't wait for weeks.

00:30:46.119 --> 00:30:48.380
Someone who would suddenly report it to the prosecution...

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.690
and handle the work this fast...

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.329
I'll do everything I can to send him to juvie...

00:31:01.329 --> 00:31:03.299
as soon as possible,

00:31:03.299 --> 00:31:05.740
so that he may never set foot in school again.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.369
Make sure to say the same even when Song Yi Heon returns.

00:31:09.539 --> 00:31:10.609
That you're friends.

00:31:30.089 --> 00:31:32.160
Why were you looking at Yi Heon these past few days?

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.069
Are you going to sue him, along with Jang Byung Chul and Park Duk Jun?

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.700
No way.

00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:40.440
I'm ignoring the calls from those guys.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.470
Then what is it?

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.440
Are you going to get information from Yi Heon and give it to them?

00:31:44.839 --> 00:31:46.539
Who the witness is, and whether he has testimony?

00:31:46.539 --> 00:31:48.480
No, that's not it.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.509
I just want to graduate quietly.

00:31:53.319 --> 00:31:54.720
Yi Heon will go to the juvie,

00:31:55.589 --> 00:31:56.589
and you want to graduate, jerk?

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.490
At first, I only teased Song Yi Heon...

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:04.630
because he was all dark,

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.529
and I only wanted him to buy alcohol...

00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:08.329
and cigarettes since he was rich.

00:32:08.329 --> 00:32:10.200
I don't know how it came this far.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.470
How am I supposed to fix this?

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.839
I'll give you the solution.

00:32:15.839 --> 00:32:17.470
You, Jang Byung Chul, and Park Duk Jun...

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.440
have the video in your phones, right?

00:32:20.309 --> 00:32:22.710
The proof where we hit and harassed Yi Heon?

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.180
Yi Heon told you to delete it, but I'm sure you didn't.

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:27.180
Do whatever it takes, whether it's stealing their phones...

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.180
or hacking their cloud storage, to gather them all...

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.490
and reveal them at the investigation.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:33.160
You, Jang Byung Chul, Park Duk Jun, and all the other guys.

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:35.259
That they are the real assailants and that Yi Heon was sued...

00:32:35.259 --> 00:32:36.559
when he was the victim.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:37.730
And also search all the CCTVs...

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:41.000
to reveal that Yi Heon is the victim, understand?

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.970
That's the solution? Then what about me?

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.039
I won't be able to attend school and go to juvie.

00:32:46.039 --> 00:32:48.940
My father handed this case over to the prosecution, you fool.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.839
If we can't testify that Yi Heon is the victim,

00:32:51.839 --> 00:32:54.210
Yi Heon will be arrested and sent to juvie...

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.240
when he is innocent.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:01.250
I don't want to.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:07.390
Yi Heon even forgave you when you tried to kidnap his mother.

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:10.730
He didn't even have the school violence committee held...

00:33:10.859 --> 00:33:12.400
because he didn't want you to get expelled.

00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:14.960
Do you think Yi Heon doesn't know that the tables will be turned...

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.329
if you say that you're the assailant?

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.599
He isn't saying anything to you when he knows everything.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:22.869
He's protecting you so you can attend school.

00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:25.710
You choose.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.609
Will you neglect it like a coward, or...

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:31.750
Will you testify, like Yi Heon did,

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:33.880
and help him out?

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:41.960
I'm not doing anything.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.630
It has nothing to do with me.

00:33:51.069 --> 00:33:53.400
Do you think Yi Heon doesn't know that the tables will be turned...

00:33:54.039 --> 00:33:55.569
if you say that you're the assailant?

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.170
He isn't saying anything to you when he knows everything.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:00.940
He's protecting you so you can attend school.

00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:03.079
Why did he have to say that nonsense?

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.219
(Byung Chul)

00:34:26.369 --> 00:34:27.469
Why won't you pick up?

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:30.210
- You came? - What are you going to do?

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:32.539
I'm not suing him.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.579
Are you really on Yi Heon's side now?

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:36.880
Are you going to testify or something?

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:38.679
And what if I do?

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.250
Then we're all dead.

00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:45.760
No, I mean...

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:47.789
If you testify that we're the assailants,

00:34:47.789 --> 00:34:49.789
I'm saying that we can't just stay still.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:51.429
We have no choice...

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:53.860
but to say that you made us do it, and that you led it.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.400
You and I are both dead.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.070
Is that a threat?

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.840
No, I mean...

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.710
- So let's sue him together. - Forget it.

00:35:05.039 --> 00:35:07.710
I'm not going to do anything. That's that.

00:35:10.679 --> 00:35:12.420
Hey, Jae Min.

00:35:13.719 --> 00:35:14.719
Darn it.

00:35:20.059 --> 00:35:21.289
Why isn't he teaming up with us?

00:35:35.369 --> 00:35:36.510
Se Kyung told me...

00:35:37.269 --> 00:35:39.210
his father transferred your case to the prosecution.

00:35:42.409 --> 00:35:43.550
It must have been tough...

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:46.219
- for Se Kyung. - But...

00:35:48.619 --> 00:35:49.789
I'm not going to come forward.

00:35:55.059 --> 00:35:56.389
I never asked you to.

00:35:59.099 --> 00:36:00.130
Why aren't you...

00:36:01.199 --> 00:36:02.369
asking me to do so?

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.300
If I testify, you won't go to juvie,

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.440
and Byung Chul and Duk Jun will get arrested.

00:36:09.809 --> 00:36:11.440
I heard my testimony is your only way out.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.239
Why aren't you asking for it, then?

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:15.650
You have no other choice.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.349
Are you going to go to juvie, then?

00:36:31.429 --> 00:36:33.099
My father opened an instalment savings account.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.869
Prepare for Tomorrow Instalment Savings.

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:39.940
It's my college tuition.

00:36:41.539 --> 00:36:42.570
Yes.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.510
I know I might not get into college with my grades.

00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:46.710
But I should at least graduate high school...

00:36:48.739 --> 00:36:49.949
if I want to go to college.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.380
I'm sorry.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.090
But I'm so scared.

00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:17.670
You won't go to juvie.

00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:29.949
A real adult...

00:37:32.489 --> 00:37:34.789
helps the kids so they won't be miserable.

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:37.190
That's what an adult should do.

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:41.760
Also, you apologized to the wrong person.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.829
When the real Yi Heon comes back,

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.570
apologize to him...

00:37:47.369 --> 00:37:48.570
on your knees.

00:37:52.809 --> 00:37:53.940
Have you eaten?

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.389
Mother is in the hospital because she is ill.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.929
The housekeeper is staying with her at the hospital,

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.730
so this is all I've got.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.969
This rice is freaking hot.

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:26.409
Do you want to get yelled at until you explode?

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:29.409
Just eat what you have.

00:38:46.699 --> 00:38:49.130
Some say people don't change.

00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:52.269
But I believe you'll be able to change.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.139
So show me how different you can be.

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.849
Just like now, don't bully others.

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.909
Don's skip school.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:08.449
And try to study hard.

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:10.719
As I told you many times,

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.619
you have to graduate high school to function...

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:15.760
as a human being.

00:39:17.929 --> 00:39:19.059
Stop lecturing me.

00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:22.159
You'd be the high school dropout if you get arrested.

00:39:27.239 --> 00:39:28.340
I mean...

00:39:29.269 --> 00:39:30.469
You're ruining dinner.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:33.110
Why are you lecturing me when my parents wouldn't?

00:39:35.179 --> 00:39:36.510
My tongue slipped because of you.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.429
You don't have to send me off.

00:39:56.369 --> 00:39:57.730
I'm on my way to visit my mother in the hospital.

00:40:08.909 --> 00:40:09.909
Hey.

00:40:13.079 --> 00:40:14.650
Why did you invite me for dinner?

00:40:17.889 --> 00:40:18.920
It was because...

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.889
you looked hungry.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.960
Jae Min.

00:40:26.659 --> 00:40:28.300
Do you know what is the thing...

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.670
you can't have more even if you want more?

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.539
And the thing you want to stop, but it won't?

00:40:36.369 --> 00:40:37.409
It's time.

00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:40.409
So, study when you still can.

00:40:41.409 --> 00:40:42.610
You should go to college, right?

00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:45.349
You said I could just graduate high school.

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:46.880
Are you an old fart or what?

00:40:49.489 --> 00:40:50.889
I get that a lot.

00:40:53.059 --> 00:40:54.159
Get home safe.

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:12.909
(Hong Jae Min started calling me a stalker.)

00:41:12.909 --> 00:41:13.909
(I hate school. I'm tired of this.)

00:41:17.079 --> 00:41:18.079
(I want to quit. I want to die.)

00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:20.150
(Will I be able to be friends with anyone?)

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.389
(I don't know what it is to share the same feelings.)

00:41:24.389 --> 00:41:26.159
(In the end, even my friends will abandon me.)

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:43.909
(To Se Kyung: "Pure EHC." Read it backward.)

00:41:49.079 --> 00:41:51.150
"Pure EHC." Read it backward

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.179
(Yi Heon: "Pure EHC." Read it backward.)

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.650
Cheer up.

00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:03.730
I heard about your father.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:06.559
It's okay. It's not your fault.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.170
What about you? Are you doing okay?

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.670
You'll be examined by the prosecution tomorrow.

00:42:15.639 --> 00:42:17.570
There were a few goals...

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.980
I wanted to achieve before Yi Heon came back.

00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:21.940
Escape school violence.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:24.309
Protect Mother.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.280
Get into university. And, make friends.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:31.090
I failed to achieve anything,

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:33.320
but I made one friend at least.

00:42:34.059 --> 00:42:35.090
So I'm glad.

00:42:36.789 --> 00:42:38.889
What do you mean? You can still achieve all your goals.

00:42:41.099 --> 00:42:42.360
I'll testify.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:43.769
Come to think of it,

00:42:44.429 --> 00:42:46.099
I saw Yi Heon getting bullied many times.

00:42:46.369 --> 00:42:48.469
Move over. I'll show it to you.

00:42:49.809 --> 00:42:51.210
- I didn't get to go. - Move over.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.469
- I didn't get to do it. - Okay.

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:57.409
I knew you'd be good at it.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:59.150
Don't worry.

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.050
I'm going to protect you.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:03.090
For some reason,

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.320
my father's threats didn't hurt as much and were bearable.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.989
It's all thanks to you.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.030
I'm going to return your favour.

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:15.159
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.630
It's grownups' job to solve a difficult problem.

00:43:18.099 --> 00:43:21.039
Also, as you know, Yi Heon is innocent.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.510
"A friend."

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.090
"A friend." I like that.

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:43.030
What?

00:43:43.889 --> 00:43:45.630
You used to hang out with your friends all the time.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:46.929
Why do you come here so often these days?

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:51.730
I have no place to sleep over, so I'm going to sleep here.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.170
What about the water? Did you get it back?

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.849
Some say people don't change.

00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:11.119
But I believe you'll be able to change.

00:44:12.989 --> 00:44:15.760
So, show me how different you can be.

00:44:29.869 --> 00:44:30.869
Darn it.

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:33.639
Why the heck are you crying? It's annoying.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.000
You're up.

00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:29.570
Yes.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:32.269
You look good today.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:34.969
Do you want some water?

00:45:41.409 --> 00:45:43.150
Well... I might...

00:45:43.949 --> 00:45:45.880
have to go out today.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:48.920
It won't take long.

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.889
Focus on getting better until I come back.

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:58.659
Is there a girl you have a crush on?

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.030
You're more built now.

00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:05.769
A man gets fitter when he likes someone.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.500
Your father was like that too.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.670
He started playing golf and going to the gym after seeing that witch.

00:46:14.239 --> 00:46:15.280
"That witch?"

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:17.849
That witch, Lee Mi Kyung.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:21.449
Recently, he even bought her an apartment to live in.

00:46:23.449 --> 00:46:25.250
But I don't know if she knows...

00:46:26.119 --> 00:46:27.960
that it means to take it and bugger off.

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.429
I'm sure he's seeing some other witch already.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.059
That's your father.

00:46:38.099 --> 00:46:39.269
When was this?

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.369
Two years ago?

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:46.510
Do you know...

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.309
where it is?

00:46:51.849 --> 00:46:54.420
It's Unit 2402, 1-dong, Hwi Castle Apartment, Jangpyeon-dong.

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:57.019
That's Lee Mi Kyung's place. Go and get her.

00:46:57.849 --> 00:47:00.389
When Byung Chul and Duk Jun's clan sees that we got her,

00:47:00.389 --> 00:47:02.519
they'll get flustered, and the investigation will go sideways.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:58.309
(Byung Chul)

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.579
I'll do it. Where do I have to be?

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:12.690
When you're home, eat and take a shower.

00:49:13.219 --> 00:49:14.519
Sleep at home from now on.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.380
Darn it.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:43.949
(Prosecution Service)

00:49:57.099 --> 00:49:58.130
Open it.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:00.599
I really shouldn't.

00:50:02.869 --> 00:50:04.869
- This is housebreaking. - Open it.

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:07.440
If you don't open it, you'll be in trouble right away.

00:50:07.539 --> 00:50:09.480
Open it! Move over.

00:50:19.019 --> 00:50:20.989
(Prosecution Service)

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:31.130
We got this.

00:50:43.409 --> 00:50:44.449
She's not here.

00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:46.679
It's indeed her place,

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:51.619
but it looks like it has been vacant for a while.

00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:02.860
Come on out.

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:04.530
- I'm not leaving. - Come.

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:05.929
I said I'm not leaving!

00:51:05.929 --> 00:51:06.940
How dare you?

00:51:16.949 --> 00:51:18.550
Aren't you supposed to be at school?

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.679
No. It's right for me to be here.

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:25.519
I told you that I wouldn't mention your name.

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.960
Couldn't you understand what I said?

00:51:28.389 --> 00:51:29.889
What the heck are you doing right now?

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:35.929
Can't you tell?

00:51:37.329 --> 00:51:38.429
I'm stabbing in the back.

00:51:54.219 --> 00:51:55.449
When I see those punks,

00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:57.719
I can see why guilty ones should get punished.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:00.719
And this way, I'll feel less unfortunate.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:02.719
Apologize.

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.860
Song Yi Heon...

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:06.429
might be a victim of this case.

00:52:06.699 --> 00:52:09.199
But what he did to you makes him an assailant.

00:52:09.199 --> 00:52:10.500
Aren't you going to apologize to me?

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:12.329
I wanted to, but I couldn't get the chance.

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:14.170
I'm sorry about everything.

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:16.139
I really want to be your friend too.

00:52:16.909 --> 00:52:17.969
I'll think about it.

00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:19.739
And about Yi Heon,

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:23.110
- is he going to another school? - "Another school?"

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.409
I didn't pay much attention back then,

00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:29.250
but he told me to take care of you when he was gone.
