(Cheongnyangni Station)

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,549
You look excited.

9
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,850
Did you go up the pedestrian overpass to lure me into this?

10
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,219
I know.

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,530
Why do I feel like I can do anything when I'm with you?

12
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,359
Here. Wipe it. It looks like I hit you.

13
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:07,469
Here.

14
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,849
Thank you.

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,780
Hold on.

16
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:21,890
Don't they have a snack bar on the train?

17
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:23,760
I think I saw it in a photo.

18
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:25,790
I'll take a look.

19
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,939
Hey, you forgot...

20
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,629
Why are they here?

21
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,280
Who are you?

22
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,520
Someone who knows your weakness very well.

23
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,780
Disband the Dongsoo Gang.

24
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:28,650
Did you think I would do that...

25
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,960
just because you told me to?

(Episode 6)

28
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,139
This is my first visit to the East Sea.

29
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,080
It looks really deep, and the waves are strong too.

30
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,180
Hey, the East Sea doesn't taste salty.

31
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,610
Try it.

32
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,180
That's nonsense.

33
00:02:58,449 --> 00:02:59,879
It's true.

34
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,129
Taste it.

35
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,300
Hey! Do you want me to kill you?

36
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,449
That must be refreshing. They somehow look free-spirited.

37
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,020
Is it because they are young?

38
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,139
What is it?

39
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:55,810
Do you have clothes to get changed?

40
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,180
No, I didn't bring any.

41
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,349
Let's go and buy clothes.

42
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,979
There's a shop just for you.

43
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,250
Okay.

44
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:12,419
What about this one?

45
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,459
I think this one is cute.

46
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,259
Do you like that one or this one?

47
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,269
- I hope your business prospers. - Bye.

48
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,420
- How many can you eat? - Three.

49
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:56,569
Step on the pedal.

50
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,069
Pedal it.

51
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,240
No. don't let it go.

52
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,480
Pedal it.

53
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:09,910
Hey.

54
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,720
- Gosh. - Oh, no.

55
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,889
Why can't he turn it like this?

56
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,360
Yes. That's right.

57
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,698
- I'm moving forward, right? - Yes. Good.

58
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,129
- I'm doing it, right? - Yes. Look forward.

59
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,769
- That's good. - Gosh. I'm riding the bicycle!

60
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,490
The itinerary of their trip...

61
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,060
is exactly the same as what I've planned for my spring trip.

62
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,628
Watch the sea, tour the market,

63
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,758
ride a bicycle along the trail,

64
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,060
and chug soju at a famous restaurant.

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,269
Are you on a picnic?

66
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,540
Pull yourself together.

67
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,579
Our goal is to follow them quietly,

68
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,250
capture him at the right moment, and put him on an airplane.

69
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,050
But we've come all the way to Gangneung.

70
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,659
Minors can stay...

71
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,589
only when they are accompanied by their parents.

72
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,560
Gosh, you're being fussy.

73
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,129
I understand that you're worried,

74
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,698
- They are minors. - do we look like troublemakers?

75
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:35,730
It's because they are high school students.

76
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,300
Do you want to talk to a grownup on the phone?

77
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,100
The adults at home will give you a confirmation.

78
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,569
It's impossible to check if they are your parents over the phone.

79
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,610
The use of your parent's credit card and authorization over the phone...

80
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,949
are not allowed in our hotel.

81
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,750
Staying at a hotel isn't going to happen.

82
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,588
I've looked into it too.

83
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:59,660
We can't even stay in motels, let alone hotels, if we're minors.

84
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
What should we do? We have nowhere to go at this hour.

85
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,129
It's too late to ask Mr. Kim to pick us up.

86
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,439
Well, there's a place I know.

87
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Let's go there.

88
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,810
I said I can't allow minors to stay because of the crackdowns.

89
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,779
I'm a member of the Chilsung Gang.

90
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,430
The Chilsung Gang is a thing of the past.

91
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,329
It's long gone.

92
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,930
Also, the Chilsung Gang doesn't accept minors like you.

93
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,839
Did you forget who got this inn back to you?

94
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,949
Even though Kim Deuk Pal is dead, it doesn't cancel what you owe him.

95
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,579
That remaining ball of the pair...

96
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,920
You should keep it until you die, should you?

97
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,310
Granny, you know me, right?

98
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,220
Kim Deuk Pal, that jerk. I'm glad he helped me,

99
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,350
but why did he tell everyone about my crotch situation?

100
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,690
He promised me himself that he'd keep the promise.

101
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:44,200
He told you about it too, right?

102
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,730
That I only have one ball.

103
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:53,799
Well,

104
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,610
did you know about it?

105
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,779
No. It's a new information.

106
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,179
Right. It happened before you joined the gang.

107
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,679
Gosh. Then why did he tell that boy?

108
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,898
Wait. How did you know...

109
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,799
that old man has a debt to pay to someone named Kim Deuk Pal?

110
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,299
I overheard it somewhere.

111
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,768
I told him that just in case, and it worked.

112
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,309
Wait. Did you live here before?

113
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,179
Is one of your family a gangster...

114
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,480
to overhear something like that?

115
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,980
Did he learn how to fight from them?

116
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:43,419
Are you taking a census?

117
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:46,320
It's just...

118
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:48,830
I used to work here for a while.

119
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,539
How does that crook know about Boss Deuk Pal so well?

120
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,049
He can't be Boss Deuk Pal's son, can he?

121
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,249
The way he stared and talked was just like that of Kim Deuk Pal.

122
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,620
Deuk Pal told him...

123
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,120
what he didn't tell you guys.

124
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:19,389
Boss, should we pull a raid on him?

125
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,960
We can drag him by his neck and ask him.

126
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,559
Didn't you see he was with a student who knows nothing?

127
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:27,570
We'll have our chance soon.

128
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,970
When the night comes, he'll naturally want to go out.

129
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,509
Aren't you going to sleep?

130
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,070
No.

131
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:39,538
I realized this place isn't really soundproof.

132
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,908
So when I put my ear against the wall,

133
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,479
I can hear the room next door.

134
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,619
So, I'll be listening.

135
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,320
And when I hear him go out, I'll catch him.

136
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,859
Are you sure that you don't need to sleep?

137
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,219
Don't worry about it.

138
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,490
I'm the type of guy who doesn't need to sleep at all.

139
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,090
I can stay up all night for a week.

140
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,320
Gosh.

141
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,759
Come.

142
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,070
You should have been more careful.

143
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,039
What happened?

144
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,039
I bumped it against the wall.

145
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,940
It was because I couldn't take it anymore.

146
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,509
When I see my father,

147
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,850
I feel suffocated.

148
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,789
It feels like I'll never get away from him.

149
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,690
So on the spur of the moment, I do something like this...

150
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,299
before I know it.

151
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,470
Anti-depressant doesn't work anymore.

152
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,899
I even passed out.

153
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,610
Since when?

154
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:19,580
Since I was born.

155
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,909
I'm still his son.

156
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,450
When I got home only five minutes late,

157
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,389
when my desk was a little bit messy,

158
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,419
or when my shirt was wrinkled,

159
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,899
I was faced with fierce verbal and physical punishment.

160
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,558
Have a bite.

161
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,200
- Nom nom. - Here.

162
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,309
Give it back to me.

163
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:50,769
I don't want to.

164
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,740
- I don't want to. - Give it back to me.

165
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,048
- I don't want to. - You.

166
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:57,179
I don't want to give it back.

167
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:08,860
These are useless for the one who can't even control his feelings.

168
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,059
Also, I told you not to hang out with such kids.

169
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:21,710
That was when I thought...

170
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,779
I shouldn't desire anything.

171
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,080
Even if it's a friend.

172
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,600
After begging my mother for a year,

173
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:49,870
I got a gift.

174
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,210
I considered it my younger sibling.

175
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,879
Look.

176
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,909
Look.

177
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,419
This happened because you were bad.

178
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,649
Since then, I couldn't disobey him.

179
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,559
And...

180
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:16,929
you started disobeying him after hanging out with me?

181
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:20,860
I thought it'd be all right as long as he didn't find out.

182
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:25,269
It's not that he comes to school to watch me.

183
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,970
But Jae Hoon took a photo of me at school.

184
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,440
And he sent the photo to Father.

185
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:34,350
On top of that...

186
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,350
Don't tell me...

187
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,850
you set up a camera...

188
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:46,090
in my room.

189
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,139
How can I not watch you when you did something like this?

190
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,710
Was it so wrong that I made a friend...

191
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,679
with someone I wanted to?

192
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,179
Was it so wrong to laugh...

193
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,889
while playing a game with a friend?

194
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,459
You promised me!

195
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,158
With or without the camera, you should have kept your promise.

196
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,729
Why do you keep deceiving your father?

197
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,600
I have obeyed you...

198
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,969
to be a nice, honest, good son.

199
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,369
But you have monitored me on everything...

200
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,570
even when I was just breathing through the camera.

201
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:36,370
Did I do so wrong?

202
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,039
So...

203
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,480
are you telling me you did everything right?

204
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,720
I didn't do everything right.

205
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,149
But I didn't do anything wrong either.

206
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,519
Father.

207
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,388
I'm not a prisoner.

208
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,159
How dare you talk back to me like this?

209
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:13,440
When I came to my senses, I left home...

210
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,909
and was at the overpass.

211
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,049
Except for the times I study,

212
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,419
I only think about how to get away from my father.

213
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,789
I think I'm becoming insane.

214
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,529
It's all my fault.

215
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:36,730
It's not your fault.

216
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,399
It's your father's fault.

217
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:42,340
I'm so scared.

218
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,049
When you're having a hard time, reach out.

219
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,960
- To who? - To a kind grownup.

220
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,190
Someone like me.

221
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:04,460
We are...

222
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:06,429
of the same age, though.

223
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,500
I told you.

224
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,528
My birth was registered late.

225
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,599
Gosh.

226
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,670
It's because you're father has no idea.

227
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,910
That's the only way he has lived.

228
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,549
He thinks that's the only way to raise his child.

229
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,750
So don't blame him.

230
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,349
Let's help him to learn about the other ways.

231
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,078
(Fully stop getting bullied at school. Make friends)

232
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,119
(Have a proper family. Protect Mom. Get into a university.)

233
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,990
I can't lose a good teacher.

234
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:14,569
(Help Se Kyung be independent of his father.)

235
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,400
(Father)

236
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,139
I knew that you would call...

237
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,269
the moment I turned on Se Kyung's phone.

238
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,980
I knew he would be with you.

239
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,509
Then how come you didn't call me?

240
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,819
Because I have no business talking to you.

241
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,119
- Put Se Kyung on the phone. - He's sleeping.

242
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,750
After spending time at the beach and getting some fresh air,

243
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
he must've been tired.

244
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:13,559
Wake him up right now.

245
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,990
Tell him to come back and beg for my forgiveness.

246
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,690
Otherwise, I won't forgive him.

247
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,559
You can let him sleep at ease...

248
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,098
at least for a day, can't you?

249
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,068
Some punk like you don't get to make that call.

250
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,640
It's Se Kyung's call.

251
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,240
I only called you, so you wouldn't worry about him.

252
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,239
I called you myself because I knew Se Kyung...

253
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,509
would be too scared to call you if I asked him to call you.

254
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,079
Your own son is scared of you.

255
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,250
Do you think that's normal?

256
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,619
He'll attend school just like any other day.

257
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,990
When Se Kyung is done sorting out his thoughts...

258
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,990
and ready to talk to you,

259
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,420
you can talk to him then.

260
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,690
You jerk!

261
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,589
- Yes. - Where are you?

262
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,359
I'm in my room.

263
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,859
Come to the second floor.

264
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,690
Okay.

265
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,799
Sir.

266
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,500
Boss wants us to come to the second floor.

267
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,440
"Boss?"

268
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,970
Boss who?

269
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:38,140
- Was that Boss Chil Sung? - No, Boss Deuk Pal.

270
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,349
Darn it.

271
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,029
How did you get Jong Cheol's phone number?

272
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,299
You changed your number.

273
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,569
Stop talking to him so casually! Darn it.

274
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,170
You'd better be Boss Deuk Pal's son or something.

275
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,940
Sir. Even if you don't think it's true, I must check it.

276
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,940
Let's draw some blood.

277
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:14,809
I'll send it to a DNA centre.

278
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,880
Do you have Kim Deuk Pal's DNA to compare mine to?

279
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:20,349
Do we need that to run a DNA test?

280
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,059
To me, you look like...

281
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:28,730
a con artist who's trying to avert this crisis by pretending...

282
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,130
to be Boss Deuk Pal's son.

283
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,630
Since we're on the subject, let me check one last time.

284
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,269
If you're not his son, we'll hand you over to Lee Mi Kyung.

285
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,240
Reminding you of your knee injury must not have been enough for you.

286
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,279
Well, I get it.

287
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:51,180
Then should I start talking about your father?

288
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,279
Watch your mouth!

289
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,249
Bring my family into this,

290
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,920
then I'll crush you even if you're a minor. Okay?

291
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,089
Your father was a farmer.

292
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,788
You bought him 2,975m² of land...

293
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,730
in Pyeongmyeon-eup, so he could farm on it.

294
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,599
But he passed away due to a chronic illness last year.

295
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,829
Your sister with a disability was sent to a care centre.

296
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:13,269
The name of the care centre is Rainbow Rehabilitation Center.

297
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,209
I'm not trying to brag.

298
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,240
I'm only saying this, so you can verify what I'm saying.

299
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,740
I paid the last month's fee for your sister.

300
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:28,150
Boss Deuk Pal used to pay it. I had forgotten about it.

301
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,990
Let's say I'm really trying to con you.

302
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,818
Then when you guys joined hands with Lee Mi Kyung...

303
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:33,960
and stabbed me in the back,

304
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,660
why would I...

305
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:38,329
pay the fee for your sister under Kim Deuk Pal's name?

306
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:44,599
Dong Soo. You're an orphan.

307
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:48,039
You and I met on the street for the 1st time when you were 19.

308
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:50,669
Your friend from the same orphanage scammed you of 3,000 dollars,

309
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,980
the money you received when you were leaving the orphanage.

310
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,250
When you were wandering the streets, I took you to a gukbap restaurant.

311
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:58,279
When you finished the food, I told you to go. Then you said...

312
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:01,690
you would work for me if I ordered a plate of suyuk.

313
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,519
Then I said...

314
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,160
"Are you saying you'll be a gangster..."

315
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,759
"for a mere 6.3 dollars?"

316
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,369
That's what he said.

317
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:18,269
If I were truly a 19-year-old con artist,

318
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,170
how would I know the precise price...

319
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,640
of the suyuk at the restaurant?

320
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,250
Dong Soo.

321
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,779
You already know everything.

322
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,019
That's right!

323
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,789
We had known everything all along.

324
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,490
Yes.

325
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:45,029
- The truth is, I am... - You are...

326
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,328
- Boss Deuk Pal's... - Kim Deuk Pal.

327
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,400
Son.

328
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,970
But we didn't want to accept it.

329
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,970
Do you know why?

330
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,139
Boss Deuk Pal had kept...

331
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,509
the existence of you from us for 20 years. That made us so angry.

332
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:03,880
Why didn't he tell us about you?

333
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,579
It made me wonder if he didn't trust us.

334
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,589
I mean... Do you know how betrayed we feel right now?

335
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,450
Sure.

336
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,288
Believing that I'm his son...

337
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:15,259
will be faster for you guys to understand what's going on.

338
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,990
If you were his son, you should've come to us...

339
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,369
and told us that you were Boss Deuk Pal's son.

340
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,869
Yes. Well, you can call us Uncles.

341
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,170
Try not to talk to us casually.

342
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,419
I'm sorry that I made you come...

343
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,220
all the way here so early in the morning.

344
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,729
Right. I brought all of your school uniforms,

345
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,329
so Se Kyung could wear one too.

346
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:51,858
If you eat your meal quickly,

347
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,759
I'll be able to drop you off at school on time.

348
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,039
Dig in. I asked him to buy some food for you too.

349
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:03,809
Okay.

350
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:08,950
The adults haven't started their meal yet.

351
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,480
Let's just eat.

352
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,289
Boss must not have been strict about manners with him.

353
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,029
Come and eat.

354
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,930
They are like my sidekicks...

355
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:31,200
No. They're my uncles.

356
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,640
Hello.

357
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,960
Don't worry.

358
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,930
Everything will work out well.

359
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:42,740
What's Hong Jae Min up to?

360
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:44,809
I'm 100 percent sure he's still working at the convenience store.

361
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,278
Still?

362
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,980
- I heard he quit. - No.

363
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,549
If we don't catch him, Boss Jong Cheol will kill us.

364
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,390
- Didn't you guys get the call? - From whom?

365
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,490
- Han Jong Cheol. - Han Jong Cheol?

366
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,190
How do you know him?

367
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,529
He's my side...

368
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:07,099
No.

369
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,700
He's a friend of my father's friend.

370
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
Bye!

371
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,279
Guys.

372
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,420
I mean...

373
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,250
Uncles.

374
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,250
I have a favour to ask you.

375
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:33,719
What favour? Just tell us.

376
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,989
You name it, and you'll get it.

377
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,960
I'll take care of Lee Mi Kyung.

378
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,190
Don't worry.

379
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:41,700
Well, you know the high school kid that ran away...

380
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:46,669
Don't look for the kid you sent to my house for the job.

381
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,969
I see. Are you talking about the kid I told the other kids to find?

382
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,640
Gosh, you got it.

383
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,880
Don't worry about it. I'll call them and sort this out.

384
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:56,380
Jong Cheol.

385
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,579
Someone isn't at school when he should've been here.

386
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,980
Did you not call them?

387
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,920
- Talk to them. - Yes, sir. Oh, my.

388
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,959
Why do I keep talking with honorifics...

389
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,059
whenever I'm on the phone with him?

390
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,170
Stop looking for that kid. Got it?

391
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,669
Study hard.

392
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,369
If you don't listen to my nephew, I'll kill you.

393
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,599
Did you hear that?

394
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:24,109
Gosh.

395
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:27,879
Hey. Isn't it better news if Hong Jae Min goes away?

396
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,650
We bullied you like that because Hong Jae Min made us do it.

397
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,849
So you had no choice?

398
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,788
Then have you ever stopped him when he wanted...

399
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:38,220
to do something bad?

400
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,420
You beat me up,

401
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,130
locked me up,

402
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,799
filmed me, and spread the videos.

403
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:47,359
Do you deny doing these things?

404
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,170
How are you any different from Hong Jae Min?

405
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,140
Name one thing if you can find a difference.

406
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,509
Can you name one? Yes?

407
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,710
No, right? That means...

408
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,949
I won't let you transfer to another school...

409
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,420
to bully other kids...

410
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,818
or quit school,

411
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:11,150
so you wander around the streets as the evils of society.

412
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,058
That's why you should stop trying to cause trouble.

413
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:15,559
You should just stay quiet in your little corner.

414
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:20,960
Darn it.

415
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,970
I quit my part-time job...

416
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:24,469
at the billiard club to catch Hong Jae Min. Darn it.

417
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,640
I did too.

418
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,140
Darn it. I thought I would be working for the gang.

419
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:34,809
Se Kyung. Yi Heon.

420
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,809
You two. I need to talk to you in the hallway now.

421
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,519
Yes, ma'am.

422
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,960
He's so annoying.

423
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,068
- Father. - Se Kyung never acted out...

424
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,240
like this!

425
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:07,809
The bad influence from you ruined him!

426
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,549
That's not true, sir.

427
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,919
Se Kyung relies on Yi Heon a lot.

428
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,149
They are really close.

429
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,288
I don't think Yi Heon had any bad influence on him.

430
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:16,788
We'll look into this thoroughly.

431
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:18,890
If you want to punish him, do so once we get the whole story.

432
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,890
Father, why don't we talk in private?

433
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,029
This happened because of me.

434
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,730
Please.

435
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,339
Could I...

436
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,569
talk to my son quietly in private?

437
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,369
Of course.

438
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,150
Then what about Yi Heon?

439
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:46,980
Let's discuss the punishment for Song Yi Heon...

440
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,720
once I finish talking to my son.

441
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,730
Let's stay outside for a moment.

442
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,829
Sir, I'll leave you two alone.

443
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,380
Did you really talk Se Kyung into spending...

444
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:13,939
the night out?

445
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,680
Did you take him to a motel and drink with him?

446
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,279
No. We just went to see the ocean. That's all.

447
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,420
High school seniors deserve a break too.

448
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,220
Besides,

449
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:27,920
I also called his father last night.

450
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:30,389
Then why did he make it sound like...

451
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,059
you dragged Se Kyung to the ocean against his will?

452
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,900
As if it would be that easy to force Se Kyung to do anything.

453
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,240
You do have a point. But he did stay with you when he didn't go home.

454
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,970
I think his father got the wrong idea.

455
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:45,480
I'll do my best to talk him out of calling...

456
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,809
the school violence committee.

457
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,650
Don't worry.

458
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,480
There won't be any meeting by the school violence committee.

459
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:55,220
I'll call for the school violence committee.

460
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:59,220
You just tell them Song Yi Heon dragged you there...

461
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,420
because that's the truth.

462
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,460
Se Kyung!

463
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,460
Se Kyung!

464
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,869
- Choi Se Kyung! - Do you hear me? Se Kyung!

465
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,808
The school nurse also said...

466
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,710
that Se Kyung passed out temporarily because of the stress.

467
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,578
If you want,

468
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:22,650
we can transport him to the hospital now.

469
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,420
There's no need.

470
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,089
I'd like to stay here a bit longer before I go back to class.

471
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,529
What a fool. How could he be so weak?

472
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,640
Could I talk to you for a moment?

473
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:52,739
I have nothing to discuss with you.

474
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,779
But I do.

475
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,210
I think Se Kyung will wake up soon.

476
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,150
Should I do it here, so he could hear us?

477
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,220
I'm busy.

478
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:05,319
I must attend my class shortly.

479
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,630
I heard a few things about parenting, you know.

480
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:19,170
There are two major types of controlling parents.

481
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,739
These parents either suffer...

482
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,740
from a severe case of separation anxiety...

483
00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:24,670
or show an extreme inclination to be perfectionists.

484
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:28,180
In my opinion, you belong to the second type.

485
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,250
You apply strict standards to yourself...

486
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:34,079
and apply the same strict standards to your son as well.

487
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,719
What?

488
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,490
You remind me of this saying.

489
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,359
"No gold can be pure."

490
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,960
"No person can be perfect."

491
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:46,900
If you don't mind me asking... Were you abused...

492
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,369
as a kid?

493
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,410
I only took such measures to raise my son right.

494
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,509
So he could grow into an upright, kind, and honest individual.

495
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:02,410
Someone who could follow the social regulations.

496
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:05,209
That's called gaslighting.

497
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,250
How dare you?

498
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:08,420
He went up to the pedestrian overpass...

499
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,190
to commit suicide.

500
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,960
He can get treated for that.

501
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,699
How could he succeed in life if he can't overcome that?

502
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,179
Do you want...

503
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,610
to lose him like that?

504
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,980
You little...

505
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,449
I know it too!

506
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,260
How it feels to be abused and take a beating.

507
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,130
That's precisely why...

508
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,289
I became a gangster.

509
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,800
You're still in high school. But you joined the gang?

510
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,729
Let go of my wrist.

511
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,868
Verbal abuse is still considered violence.

512
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:01,499
Words can be as sharp as knives.

513
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,539
If you wield them wrongly, you can hurt people too.

514
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,869
Then...

515
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:07,039
those scars will last forever.

516
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,590
If you want to save Se Kyung, you should get treated first.

517
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,388
Please think about it again.

518
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:22,489
If you were abusing your son or not.

519
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,459
How dare you lecture an adult? How arrogant of you!

520
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,599
If you want to call yourself an adult,

521
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:31,229
you should help your son grow into a good adult.

522
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,869
A real adult would do that.

523
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,449
Please go home today, so Se Kyung can study at school.

524
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,280
Go home and get rid of the security camera first.

525
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:07,699
Yes. Hello, Principal.

526
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,710
This is Choi Myung Hyun.

527
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,150
Did you sleep well?

528
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:27,019
Yes.

529
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,230
Where's my father?

530
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,869
He left.

531
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,769
He's not the type to leave so willingly.

532
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,340
What did you say to make him leave?

533
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:47,179
That he is the one who needs to be treated.

534
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,210
I told him that he should treat his trauma first,

535
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,420
in order to save you.

536
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,989
It would have been the first time he heard anything like that.

537
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,789
I don't think there's anyone who can say that to my father.

538
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:05,389
There's me.

539
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,659
Why is everything so easy for you?

540
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:11,929
Why does everything become simple and clear when you do it?

541
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,599
Both Yi Heon and my problems.

542
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,170
How do you make it seem like it's nothing?

543
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,380
It's hard if you try to avoid it before you even face it.

544
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,179
Many turn out to be simple when you actually face it.

545
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,849
You should also tell him to listen to what you have to say.

546
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,860
Your words will be stronger than mine to your father.

547
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,190
Okay.

548
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,429
I'll try hard.

549
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:43,199
I don't know if it's possible,

550
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,369
but I will try until the end.

551
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,940
Don't rush it.

552
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,039
You have to keep your place as a student first.

553
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,280
That way, you can hold your head high.

554
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:57,849
Think of your future first,

555
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,780
believe in yourself, and go forward.

556
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,719
You're going to the study room, right?

557
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:09,360
It's midterms soon.

558
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,599
Let's work hard to catch up on what we missed until now.

559
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,630
Oh, midterms...

560
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,269
Let's go and eat first.

561
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,170
Lunch will be over soon.

562
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,570
Gosh...

563
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,110
Are you done? Let's go.

564
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,929
Let's eat.

565
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:53,768
Se Kyung, Grandpa is coming home today.

566
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:55,869
He wants to see you. I'll introduce you to him.

567
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,469
I saw you took my pictures.

568
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,448
You were going in the wrong direction...

569
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:04,110
So you gave it to my father...

570
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,320
before he even mentioned it?

571
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,289
They say "to forget the favour and betray one's loyalty."

572
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:13,118
To give up on loyalty and do them dirty.

573
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,619
(Meaning "to forget the favour and betray one's loyalty")

574
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,659
You even got the highest grades by studying with me.

575
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,630
So why did you do that?

576
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,469
It wasn't because I didn't like you...

577
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,940
- I hate seeing Song Yi Heon... - I'm sorry, but...

578
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:30,710
I hate seeing you.

579
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,710
And could you go...

580
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,739
if you're done eating?

581
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:48,559
Hey, how was that?

582
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,289
You were similar to me,

583
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,199
but you need to practice your charisma.

584
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,510
(This is my favourite drink. Drink this, and good luck!)

585
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,210
You came today.

586
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:14,380
Good luck with your studies.

587
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,650
Good luck.

588
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,670
This is my favourite drink. Drink this, and good luck!

589
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,500
I think that girl...

590
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:36,969
has the same taste in drinks as I do.

591
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,840
"Taste?"

592
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,050
Sure. Taste...

593
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:04,999
Hey, you.

594
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,940
- Stop the nonsense. - What are you doing?

595
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,010
Did Song Yi Heon turn me in?

596
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:13,880
You knew about his relationship with the gangsters, didn't you?

597
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,779
That's why you dumped us and hung around him, right?

598
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,309
What kind of nonsense is that?

599
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,480
What relationship does he have with the gangsters?

600
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,250
Boss Han Jong Cheol is Song Yi Heon's father's friend's...

601
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,550
friend's friend's...

602
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,119
Something like that.

603
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:27,959
Song Yi Heon is really a gangster?

604
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,829
That scum, Song Yi Heon, called Boss in front of us...

605
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,959
and told us not to bother you.

606
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,029
Why would he do that?

607
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,130
I don't know!

608
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:39,129
That's what I can't understand, and it's driving me crazy.

609
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,170
I quit my part-time job trying to catch you.

610
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,238
Do you know how much we spent until now?

611
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,909
They even said that they would provide jobs for us.

612
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,110
Do you expect us to quit now?

613
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,078
Says who?

614
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,449
We're going to get you.

615
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:53,880
We're going to drag you to them and demand for jobs.

616
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,780
If not, at least some operating money.

617
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,929
Do you know why I avoided you guys?

618
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,860
I didn't want to hit you.

619
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,159
I thought of you as my friends.

620
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:19,210
Fine, let me kill you today.

621
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:22,239
Thanks for everything, you scumbags.

622
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:53,739
Thanks.

623
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,679
You really give me strength.

624
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,110
I'm going to go home early today and talk to my father.

625
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,880
Finish off today's workload when you get up.

626
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,119
Medicine!

627
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:08,789
Where's the medicine?

628
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,189
The medicine!

629
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,590
I'm going crazy! I think I'm going to die!

630
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,530
- Your mother's medicine... - Is something wrong?

631
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:18,329
She ran out of medicine because Ms. Lee isn't coming.

632
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,809
Medicine! Call Ms. Lee.

633
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,139
Call her and tell her to bring medicine!

634
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,209
Ms. Lee isn't coming anymore.

635
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,050
No, she can't.

636
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,920
Then who will bring my medicine?

637
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:35,519
Medicine...

638
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,420
I'm going to go buy my medicine, so don't stop me!

639
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:43,389
The anxiety is killing me!

640
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,889
Go back inside,

641
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:47,260
and I will buy it at the pharmacy.

642
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,829
You're serious, right?

643
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:52,699
You have to buy it.

644
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,179
It seemed like antidepressants.

645
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:02,849
Will they have it at the pharmacy?

646
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,449
I don't think she should take it at all.

647
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,420
If they have it at the pharmacy, I will buy the weakest one.

648
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:10,618
Yes.

649
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:13,158
She should get treated at the hospital tomorrow.

650
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:14,190
Yes.

651
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,989
Could you please prepare some hot tea?

652
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,460
I will feed her something and clean up the place.

653
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,960
Go on.

654
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,829
Goodness me...

655
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:35,279
(Chlorpromazine)

656
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,679
(Loravan)

657
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,550
Who is taking all this?

658
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,150
Are you taking this medicine?

659
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,820
- What is it? - These antidepressants...

660
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,829
and antipsychotics were too strong.

661
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,459
If you experience lethargy after taking antidepressants,

662
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,860
antipsychotics are sometimes taken together.

663
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,639
But these are strong ones that aren't usually used here.

664
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,969
The side effects are severe, and they can be addictive.

665
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,809
Why would they prescribe this much of such medicine?

666
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,839
And the dosage is too high,

667
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,179
so if you get addicted, returning to normal life may can be difficult.

668
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,750
Supersensitivity, insomnia, anxiety,

669
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,649
and in rare cases, you may even suffer from mental illnesses...

670
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,690
like visual impairment, convulsions, or panic disorders.

671
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,959
(Pharmacy)

672
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,960
Dong Soo.

673
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,800
How did you meet that woman, Lee Mi Kyung?

674
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,769
She's very meticulous,

675
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,139
so we have no way to contact her, either.

676
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:38,840
If you leave a message to a third party,

677
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,139
she will come to you.

678
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,679
I already left a message because I felt the need to meet up.

679
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,079
I think she will come today.

680
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,079
Why, though?

681
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,119
That woman gave Mother medicine.

682
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:52,618
It's said to be very addictive,

683
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,419
so it's hard to find within the country.

684
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,559
If addicted, she could suffer from mental illnesses.

685
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,359
She used Mother's name to get the prescription,

686
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,400
so there's no way to legally punish Lee Mi Kyung.

687
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:02,969
So...

688
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:06,340
I will have to punish her myself.

689
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,500
Find Lee Mi Kyung.

690
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,440
Find her...

691
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:13,480
and bring her to me.

692
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:23,650
"Mental illnesses?"

693
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,960
As in going crazy?

694
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,119
Is that our nephew?

695
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:31,428
Is our nephew going crazy?

696
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:33,429
No, that Lee Mi Kyung woman gave our Boss's wife...

697
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,899
I mean, Yi Heon's mother,

698
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,169
medicine that will make her go crazy.

699
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,170
What?

700
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,500
Hey. Boss. Let's go.

701
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:46,679
But Boss, Lee Mi Kyung is the one who saved Chil Sung.

702
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:47,809
Will it be alright?

703
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,880
We promised to cover her back.

704
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,509
The buildings you're taking care of...

705
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,518
all belong to Lee Mi Kyung.

706
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,719
If we get her,

707
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,888
our gang may get into trouble...

708
00:46:57,889 --> 00:46:59,960
and end up in the streets.

709
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:03,030
We already have the boys running away as it is.

710
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,860
And Boss,

711
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,800
do you even know where Lee Mi Kyung is when you say that?

712
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:09,799
I don't know, you...

713
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,468
You scumbag.

714
00:47:11,469 --> 00:47:13,570
So what are we supposed to do?

715
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:18,339
Looking at how idle you seem to be, I assume you didn't get much done.

716
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,980
So why did you call me over?

717
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:23,179
How is it going with Song Yi Heon?

718
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:26,650
Aren't you guys working?

719
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,618
I told you to bring him over so long ago.

720
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:30,650
Don't sit there.

721
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:37,260
- What? - The Dongsoo Gang...

722
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,130
is breaking up.

723
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,000
When Boss Chil Sung got stabbed by the other gang...

724
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:48,500
and was in critical condition,

725
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:53,980
you were the sole person who helped.

726
00:47:57,849 --> 00:47:59,980
Trying to bring back the Chilsung Gang,

727
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,650
I thought it would work.

728
00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:06,860
But no.

729
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:09,630
When Boss Chil Sung was hurt,

730
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,829
that's when it should have been broken up.

731
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:16,869
Working with you, I must have forgotten,

732
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,969
but what our Boss hates the most...

733
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:22,900
is messing around with kids and family members.

734
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,880
Whose kid?

735
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,349
Not anyone's kid. Minors.

736
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,420
I tolerated the kids,

737
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,590
but an uncle needs to protect his nephew, don't you think?

738
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:42,789
"Uncle?"

739
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:47,260
Are you saying Song Yi Heon is your nephew?

740
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,329
Then am I his older sister?

741
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,339
How stupid of you, not understanding the family tree.

742
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,409
Hey! Don't you remember I saved your Boss?

743
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:58,170
You need to pay back for that!

744
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:02,679
You're right.

745
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,449
To pay back for that,

746
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:07,380
I will let you go this time.

747
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,050
Gosh, this is a huge act of kindness.

748
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:14,719
Otherwise, you would have been dragged away by now.

749
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,099
Instead, go to our nephew yourself,

750
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:23,570
get on your knees, and beg.

751
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:28,769
I will give you three days.

752
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,869
After that, you won't see this kind of treatment...

753
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:34,579
or consideration.

754
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,150
Are you guys crazy?

755
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,949
Let go!

756
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,849
I said, let go!

757
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,389
Let go! Hey!

758
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,788
You! The area you're managing... The buildings...

759
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:50,889
I'm going to give them all to the other guys.

760
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,229
- Let go of me! - Gosh...

761
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,360
- Hey! Let go! - What a powerful voice.

762
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,629
See you.

763
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,230
Let's not ever see each other again.

764
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:01,070
Just you wait...

765
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,510
Are you sure? It's crazy.

766
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,769
I heard it.

767
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,510
The address we got last time...

768
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,409
was Song Yi Heon's house,

769
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,909
and they went to kidnap a person.

770
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,320
Hey, let's go inside.

771
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:16,888
Go and say that we will report it to the police...

772
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,089
if they don't pay us the money we spent on following Hong Jae Min.

773
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,959
Hong Jae Min can't even lie,

774
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,289
so he will cry and tell the truth at the police station.

775
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:24,690
Then it will be over for the Dongsoo Gang.

776
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,900
Hey, friend.

777
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,139
How do you guys know Song Yi Heon?

778
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:38,510
We just go to the same school.

779
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:42,239
It seems like you had a hard time as well.

780
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:46,980
Who's in the same class?

781
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:52,650
(Hansong High School)

782
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,190
Did he really pass out?

783
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,158
What?

784
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:57,289
They were so close.

785
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:12,769
Yi Heon.

786
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,010
You weren't in it, were you?

787
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:17,949
What?

788
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,380
We are in the classroom.

789
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:23,289
And also in the school.

790
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:27,320
I guess Choi Se Kyung isn't here yet?

791
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:31,789
Is it true that Se Kyung passed out a few days ago...

792
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,530
because of you?

793
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:36,800
Did you hit him?

794
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,239
I heard you also threatened Lee Jae Hoon.

795
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:42,469
I...

796
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,840
Can you make it clear so that I understand?

797
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:50,649
Did you drag Se Kyung...

798
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,380
into a motel?

799
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,550
And make him drink?

800
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,589
That you're venting on Se Kyung...

801
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:57,889
after getting bullied by Hong Jae Min's gang.

802
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,058
That you're harassing the student government president.

803
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:01,260
What are you talking about...

804
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,760
Where did you guys hear all that?

805
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,960
You were referred to the school violence committee.

806
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:12,000
I brought what our parents received.

807
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:14,639
Oh, no...

808
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,908
(Issue: Song Yi Heon's threat and assault against Choi Se Kyung)

809
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:18,269
(School Violence Committee Head)

810
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:20,179
The day Se Kyung's father came,

811
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,039
they held the meeting right away.

812
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,479
Song Yi Heon of Class 3-3...

813
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,078
coaxed his classmate, my son Choi Se Kyung,

814
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,519
to sleep out,

815
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:34,618
and there has been testimony that he has been...

816
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:35,960
continuously bullying his classmates.

817
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:40,030
And there are circumstances where he was involved with gangsters.

818
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,259
- What? - Gangsters?

819
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,469
- Gangsters? - Is that true?

820
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,070
Does it make sense that...

821
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,710
such a student is openly studying...

822
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:52,769
with our children at school?

823
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:54,980
- No way. - Of course not.

824
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,480
I believe such student should be handled properly,

825
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:01,449
so I would like to propose to hold the school violence committee.

826
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:06,050
The principal already approved,

827
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,389
so if the school can't properly take care of it,

828
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,690
I will take it to the prosecution right away.

829
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,329
So this is what you're doing?

830
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,239
The number you have dialled cannot be reached.

831
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,000
(Choi Se Kyung)

832
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:30,250
Song Yi Heon?

833
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:34,150
There are two more students, Jang Byung Chul and Park Duk Jun.

834
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:35,949
Anyway, you know them, right?

835
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:38,420
Yes, I do.

836
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,488
(Seoul Police Station)

837
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:41,718
Those students...

838
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,730
just filed a complaint against you for school violence.

839
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:53,869
Is this what taking the blame is?

840
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:57,809
It's not easy holding out...

841
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:59,710
as a high-schooler.

842
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:09,579
Fine.

843
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,989
I guess I underestimated you.

844
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:14,690
Let's do this again...

845
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:17,659
properly.

846
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,968
There's this woman, Lee Mi Kyung, who instigated Mother's kidnap.

847
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:28,440
She coaxed the guys...

848
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,239
to sue me.

849
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,339
Do you now see what lousy kids you were hanging around with?

850
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,038
Are you suing him because of me?

851
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:38,279
And if he files a countercharge, you will be brought up for sure.

852
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,678
And then you will both end up in the juvenile hall.

853
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:41,279
Just sue him with us.

854
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,879
We're much more advantageous.

855
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,449
Yi Heon will go to jail, and that scumbag will graduate?

856
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:46,860
I will give you the solution.

857
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:50,328
You, Jang Byung Chul, Park Duk Jun, and all the other guys.

858
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,988
Yi Heon got sued when they are the real assailants...

859
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:53,400
and Yi Heon was the victim.

860
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,429
Shouldn't you be at school?

861
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,300
What do you think you're doing?

862
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,599
Can't you tell? I'm throwing a low blow on you.
