(High School Return of a Gangster)

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:37.609
Did I make you surprise?

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.909
I'm Seo Chil Sung.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.280
I'm a brother of Yi Heon's father, Kim Deuk Pal.

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:49.320
I think you've got the wrong person.

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:52.359
I'm sure he is Song Yi Heon.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.560
Do you want to deny that he's Deuk Pal's son?

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.770
Or are you keeping it a secret so that no one can know...

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.600
he's not Chairman Bae's son?

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.500
No. I don't know who Deuk Pal is.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.500
Is it true...

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.439
that you just got out of a drug addiction?

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.049
He prevented you from getting kidnapped.

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.049
He was a victim of school violence,

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.719
but he was named as the bully instead.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.950
So he went to the police station and the prosecutors' office.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.760
With all that going on, he's still here to take care of you.

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:25.560
Did you know about all those?

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.060
Parents have to be...

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:35.530
Parents have to be guards.

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.500
The guards who protect their children.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.739
The children without these guards...

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:42.969
are destined to be unfortunate.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.510
Learning to live alone early in life doesn't do any good.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.920
Get a hold of yourself.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.250
If you don't,

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:54.920
you might also lose your kid.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:58.859
Do you get that?

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.129
What is our nephew doing?

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:12.599
Children are sleepyheads.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.409
Yes. They say kids like to sleep.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.110
How old is he again?

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.979
Yi Heon is 19 years old.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.479
That means it was 19 years ago.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.919
Deuk Pal was in Gangwon Province 19 years ago.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.849
So there weren't any girls around him.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.990
If he saw an actress,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.189
I would have remembered.

(High School Return of a Gangster)

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.110
I told you that I wouldn't mention your name.

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.650
Couldn't you understand what I said?

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.250
What the heck are you doing right now?

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.490
Can't you tell?

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.620
I'm stabbing in the back.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.889
In these punks' backs.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.930
- Hey. - There's a tablet PC.

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:14.770
Its password is 808706.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.039
Hey, take it away from him. If he opens it, we're doomed.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.969
What are you doing?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.449
Yes. I'm Chief Prosecutor Choi Myung Hyun.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.060
Send security guards to the Investigation Room 1002.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.300
- Hey, Park Duk Jun! - What?

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.069
- Darn it. - You crazy punk.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:52.669
Come on out.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.849
Are you filming this right now?

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.960
Did you harass...

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.430
all the kids on here?

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:39.120
Eat it already.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.889
Chew it.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.019
Chew and swallow it.

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:47.660
I'm the assailant.

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:50.959
With them, I beat up Song Yi Heon,

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.629
mugged, and harassed him.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.930
Yi Heon jumped off the pedestrian overpass...

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:58.870
because of me.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.810
Why did you do this?

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.689
I was the only one who knew he carried his tablet PC in his bag.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.490
In other words,

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.189
no one could reveal you were a victim except for me.

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:19.689
If the truth wasn't revealed,

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:23.699
that pervert would have kept bragging about it like a war trophy.

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:25.430
No.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.029
Why didn't you listen to me?

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.230
I said I'd give you a chance.

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:31.970
Your father started the instalment savings.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.769
I gave you a chance to use it, but why did you throw it away?

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:36.470
It felt gross that you were going to be put behind bars.

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.209
I despise Se Kyung, but he was right.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.279
When I see those punks,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.750
I can see why guilty ones should get punished.

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:50.019
And this way, I'll feel less unfortunate.

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:57.829
You punk.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.970
Why did you feed me?

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.459
I gave you a chance.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.800
This wouldn't have happened...

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:35.300
if you withdrew the complaint and apologized sincerely.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.089
Are we really...

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.189
getting expelled?

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:58.620
That lady's lawyer will help us, right?

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:01.930
Do you have the lawyer's number?

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.699
I called him earlier,

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.769
but the lawyer said he was pulling out.

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:11.800
Why is he making a fuss when the rest were quiet? Seriously!

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:16.810
Song Yi Heon, he'll be half-dead when I get out of here.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.209
If you ever touch him, you're all dead meat.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.250
Darn it.

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:39.699
Why can't I reach you?

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.870
Your mother is going through the discharge procedure,

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.670
saying that she'll receive treatment as an outpatient.

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:24.079
I'm sorry.

(Emergency transport, Ministry of Justice)

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.539
Apologize.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.809
Why do I have to apologize?

00:08:54.809 --> 00:08:56.210
Because you made Yi Heon an assailant...

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:59.279
and made him nervous by sending him here.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.019
I didn't mention it to him, but you almost blackmailed him.

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:06.279
Apologize to him.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.720
Song Yi Heon might be a victim of this case.

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:14.429
But what he did to you makes him an assailant.

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:16.730
I made myself clear.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.659
That you should stay away from him to live a decent life.

00:09:22.169 --> 00:09:23.470
We moved here because they said...

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.440
it had a good school district, but it wasn't true.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.370
I should have sent you to a private high school...

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.039
so that you could make better friends with similar backgrounds.

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:33.409
Darn it.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.879
Okay. You'll transfer to another school at once!

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.049
I'm not going to another school.

00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:40.919
If you force me,

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.950
I'll drop out of school.

00:09:45.059 --> 00:09:46.259
I'll study by myself.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.389
Also, I'll continue to be friends with Yi Heon.

00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:51.929
For goodness' sake.

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:55.570
Do you want to get kicked out? Do you want us to abandon you?

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:00.669
You might abandon me,

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.210
but I won't abandon you.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.110
I'll grow up to be an honourable, honest adult,

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.779
who won't shame you, so keep watching me.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.519

(Hyunwoo University Hospital)

00:10:29.169 --> 00:10:30.399
Hey, our nephew. We're here.

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:44.049
Boss.

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:53.620
Wait.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.860
I heard you had surgery.

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:57.860
Which area did you get operated on? Are you okay now?

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.929
I'm okay.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.769
We get stabbed all the time, you know.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.669
This is the problem.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.299
You hurt your shoulders before.

00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:07.269
And you also hurt your head...

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:09.669
while fighting in Gangneung. You laughed it out...

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:10.879
while getting treated and taking medication.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.080
This is why we can't assist you properly.

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:15.809
You lost weight too. In fact, you look starving.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.889
I've never been this heavy in my life, though.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.090
By the way,

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:28.830
have we ever met personally before?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.070
My father said...

00:11:37.169 --> 00:11:39.139
he was like a father to him.

00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:47.710
Why did you leave the field?

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.220
The Chilsung Gang without you...

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:53.779
isn't the Chilsung Gang, is it?

00:11:57.419 --> 00:11:59.919
I can see why they say you were his son.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.059
I went up to the ward to see you.

00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:05.129
And your mother...

00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:07.700
was waiting for the doctor...

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.870
for the last consultation before she leaves.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.299
I think we have some time.

00:12:14.169 --> 00:12:15.210
Have a seat.

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:21.610
We'll wait outside.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.960
When I was lying in bed for a week after the surgery,

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.690
all of a sudden,

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:37.460
I got scared of fighting.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.200
If a gangster gets afraid, it's over for him.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.340
Maybe that was why...

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.440
I hurried to pass down the Chilsung Gang to Deuk Pal.

00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:52.110
Right.

00:12:53.409 --> 00:12:55.549
If Deuk Pal was still here, our Chilsung Gang would be...

00:12:58.279 --> 00:12:59.379
Our Chilsung Gang...

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.559
But he is not here, is he?

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.190
You should let him go.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.269
When I...

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.769
first heard of Deuk Pal's son, I thought it was ridiculous.

00:13:21.309 --> 00:13:24.539
He was the one who made a scene at Deuk Pal's funeral.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.509
Still,

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:30.610
I came with the thought of checking him myself.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:31.919
When I met you,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.149
I found it even more ridiculous.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.759
Look.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.759
I tried to find a resemblance.

00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:43.490
But you look nothing like him.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.909
I thought my boys were being fooled by a kid.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.750
I carry all sorts of talismans in my wallet.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.379
In spring, I pay tribute in a temple.

00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:07.850
I believe in folk religions, ghosts, and superstitions.

00:14:09.289 --> 00:14:10.289
But...

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.360
I...

00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:23.200
I don't know...

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.769
if I should be sad or happy...

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.669
about feeling your presence...

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.279
momentarily like this.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.250
He knows that I'm Kim Deuk Pal.

00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:44.220
We need to...

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.690
let go of the dead and move on.

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:49.830
I stayed until now...

00:14:51.059 --> 00:14:52.559
only to protect this young kid.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.470
Right.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.399
Right.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.509
Wasn't it because you wanted to go to school?

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.789
By the way, are you getting good scores?

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:20.289
I'm somewhere between Grade 4 and Grade 5.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.090
If you couldn't get good grades when you did nothing but studying,

00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:26.500
you're just not bright.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.029
Sir.

00:15:28.669 --> 00:15:30.669
It isn't easy to get a Grade One.

00:15:31.669 --> 00:15:32.669
Is that so?

00:15:43.149 --> 00:15:44.320
For me,

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.990
Deuk Pal was always Grade 1.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.580
It feels like...

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.649
I'm losing my man twice.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.590
Did something happen between you and our nephew?

00:16:28.659 --> 00:16:31.200
You stay here and help Deuk Pal.

00:16:31.659 --> 00:16:32.759
Take your time.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.379
Why do you keep on insisting?

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.210
She can't, right?

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.409
She'll be in big trouble if she goes home now, right?

00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:52.179
Didn't you just hear him?

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:54.820
This hospital's psychiatric clinic doesn't allow long-term stay,

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.389
but they took me in...

00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:58.059
because Yi Heon begged them about it so much.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.620
He said I should get discharged from the hospital.

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:02.730
Also,

00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:05.359
I did get much better.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.130
I don't know. You can't leave.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.869
Whatever. You go ahead and live here, then.

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:12.940
I'm leaving.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.140
Tell her that I can go home.

00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:20.109
Even the doctor said it was okay,

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:21.609
but she just wouldn't let me go.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:25.079
Yi Heon, she'll be in big trouble if she goes home now, right?

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.849
Is it okay for her to go home?

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:30.289
She got much better.

00:17:30.619 --> 00:17:32.359
She still needs to be treated for a while,

00:17:32.359 --> 00:17:33.490
so you can come and see the doctor.

00:17:33.759 --> 00:17:35.490
It's important for her to register at a rehab centre...

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:36.789
to beat the temptation...

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:39.230
by talking a lot to the survivors...

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.759
who have overcome the addiction.

00:17:44.099 --> 00:17:46.099
Okay. Please discharge her, then.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.740
I'm going home.

00:17:52.109 --> 00:17:55.250
What if Lee Mi Kyung, that crazy witch, comes for you?

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.980
How can I stop her when she wants to go home so much?

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.289
Also, she'll have to return to society one day.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.789
I'll try my best to take care of the issue regarding Mi Kyung.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.660
Why is he taking so long?

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:15.200
It was Mr. Kim's day off today.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.329
It must take some time for him to get ready.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.269
There's a girl, for sure.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.369
When a man has a girlfriend, he speaks softly.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.079
On top of that, you looked me in the eye...

00:18:25.079 --> 00:18:26.309
while speaking coherently.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.509
Who is this girl?

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.579
You are the one who should become independent from Father...

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.390
and meet a nice guy.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.759
I stayed home for 20 years.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.900
It's been more than 20 years since I made money myself.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.299
Also, you need to go to college.

00:18:48.299 --> 00:18:50.099
- If I leave him now... - This is why...

00:18:51.269 --> 00:18:52.670
you and Song Yi Heon...

00:18:53.069 --> 00:18:55.809
couldn't say anything while suffering from Mi Kyung.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.710
Think about it.

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:01.380
Will Chairman Bae come to Yi Heon's graduation?

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.049
Do you think he's a guy...

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.950
who will sit on the father's seat at Yi Heon's wedding?

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.190
He didn't even register Yi Heon as his son.

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:13.259
In times of trouble, he wasn't by your side...

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:17.230
or listened to you. Then he's not your family, is he?

00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:20.859
Consider becoming independent from him.

00:19:21.569 --> 00:19:22.630
You can do it.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.410
Why isn't he coming?

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.039
Do you want to grab a cab instead?

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.380
(Participating in Berlin Build Expo, OK Construction)

00:19:50.759 --> 00:19:51.759
Yi Heon.

00:19:53.329 --> 00:19:55.869
You can go first. I'm going to go and see Chairman Bae.

00:19:56.369 --> 00:19:58.369
Think about how you could be independent.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.769
Please take her home.

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:01.670
How are you going to see him?

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.039
You can't even reach him.

00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:06.809
I think I know where to find him, so I'm going to go and check.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.509
Goodness.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.380
Yi Heon!

00:20:14.849 --> 00:20:15.990
To the airport, please.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.920
(Privacy Mode, Accept, Decline, On Hold)

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.660
(Privacy Mode, Accept, Decline, On Hold)

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.500
Where are you?

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:29.430
Actually, we talked to the guys about the future...

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:31.599
and sent off some.

00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:35.069
We are on our way to meet you. Where are you?

00:20:35.369 --> 00:20:38.309
Come to the airport. Chairman Bae was in Berlin.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.609
We can get Lee Mi Kyung once we see Chairman Bae, right?

00:20:42.279 --> 00:20:43.809
How did you find out?

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:46.150
We couldn't find him though we tried so hard.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:47.450
(Participating in Berlin Build Expo, OK Construction)

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:50.250
He will land in an hour.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.660
Push the gas hard to get to the airport within an hour.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.390
Let's meet with Chairman Bae...

00:20:57.759 --> 00:21:00.329
and put an end to Lee Mi Kyung.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.869
- Yes, sir! - Let's go.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.140
Se Kyung.

00:21:11.109 --> 00:21:12.509
Why isn't Yi Heon coming to school?

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.710
Well, actually...

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:15.950
Don't tell me...

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.750
he's trying to avoid apologizing to Min Ji.

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:20.619
Why isn't he coming after saying her face is big?

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.190
Your face is not big. You know that, right?

00:21:24.319 --> 00:21:26.559
Actually...

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.630
Please come closer.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.730
Yi Heon was investigated by the prosecution.

00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:37.029
What?

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:40.140
Was it because Byung Chul's clan filed a complaint?

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.769
Our teacher said he was absent due to a family issue.

00:21:42.769 --> 00:21:44.369
- Was that a pure lie, then? - Gosh.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.640
How's Yi Heon?

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.980
Is he all right?

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.410
Yes. Thanks to Jae Min's help.

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:55.849
I'm jealous of Yi Heon.

00:21:55.849 --> 00:21:58.019
He has friends like you who worry about him.

00:21:58.019 --> 00:21:59.289
So how did it turn out?

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.529
Was Jae Min's help no use?

00:22:02.059 --> 00:22:03.460
Did Yi Heon get arrested?

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.759
No. He is the victim.

00:22:05.759 --> 00:22:07.130
The assailants were arrested.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.099
Yi Heon told me he wouldn't come to school...

00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:10.170
to visit his mother in the hospital.

00:22:10.599 --> 00:22:11.670
By the way,

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.099
why did Jae Min help Yi Heon?

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:16.910
I know. He bullied Yi Heon all the time.

00:22:17.809 --> 00:22:18.809
Why help him now?

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:27.279
This is the Prosecutors' Office. My workplace.

00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:29.289
How dare you get into a fight here?

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.619
Were you born to humiliate me?

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:34.960
Come, everyone.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.130
(Prosecutor's Room)

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.500
Follow me.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.640
Why didn't you listen to me?

00:22:49.809 --> 00:22:51.109
I said I'd give you a chance.

00:22:51.579 --> 00:22:53.210
Your father started the instalment savings.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:55.910
I gave you a chance to use it, but why did you throw it away?

00:22:57.279 --> 00:23:00.519
I know. He got bullied so much, but...

00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:04.589
Have you ever had a friend...

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:06.890
who suddenly felt like a grown-up?

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:09.529
That their personality and how they speak changed completely...

00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:10.589
like a different person?

00:23:11.799 --> 00:23:15.230
As if they have a dual personality.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.730
Have you had anyone like that?

00:23:19.599 --> 00:23:21.339
- I have. - Me too.

00:23:21.509 --> 00:23:22.970
You know Ji A from Class A, right?

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.609
She has a dual personality.

00:23:24.609 --> 00:23:26.809
When she's with us, she's such an extrovert.

00:23:26.809 --> 00:23:29.779
But when she goes out with someone, she turns into an introvert.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.650
That's dual personality, right?

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.890
Byun Ji Hye, the popular one who sang at the school festival.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.289
Wonder of Born Boys is the same. He has a severe dual personality.

00:23:38.289 --> 00:23:42.329
But it's not just on a special occasion or to a specific person.

00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:44.960
What if they are like that to everyone in every situation?

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.299
He looks just like the one I know from the outside,

00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:50.299
but he talks and behaves like a different person.

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:53.970
That's not a dual personality. That's being possessed.

00:23:54.569 --> 00:23:56.470
I know well about it because I'm into "DOD" these days.

00:23:57.809 --> 00:23:58.809
"DOD."

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.609
It's a web-based novel called "Debut or Die."

00:24:01.609 --> 00:24:02.650
I see.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.450
The soul who couldn't leave behind the way he spoke...

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.220
and his lifestyle and behaviour...

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.019
goes into someone else's body...

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:11.690
and lives with that body.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.319
That soul can really be that of an adult, then.

00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:15.529
That's right.

00:24:16.059 --> 00:24:17.829
Like in "DOD,"

00:24:17.829 --> 00:24:20.059
an ordinary student who failed the national exam...

00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:22.900
wakes up to find himself as an idol.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.569
Or an ordinary employee suddenly becomes a prince of a divine land.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.769
That means a grown-up can be a kid too.

00:24:32.079 --> 00:24:33.079
Does it make its title,

00:24:34.009 --> 00:24:35.049
"High School Return..."

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.380
"of a Grown-Up?"

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.279
No. If he's an ordinary grown-up, it's no fun.

00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:43.450
Well...

00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:47.859
What if a grown-up gangster becomes a high school kid?

00:24:47.859 --> 00:24:48.890
- What? - Nice.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.359
"High School Return of a Gangster."

00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:53.059
- Nice. Yes. - Sounds fun, right?

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:54.559
I like it.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.099
By the way, who got possessed?

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.710
Goodness. Whenever I smell the scent of Korea,

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.779
I crave seolleongtang with lots of kkakdugi in it.

00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:14.450
Mr. Jeon, since you won one contract,

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:15.819
have one piece of kkakdugi.

00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:19.589
Mr. Goo, you also won one contract, but it was a significant deal.

00:25:19.589 --> 00:25:21.119
So you can have all the kkakdugi you want.

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:22.130
Thank you, sir.

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:25.859
I'll keep an eye on how much kkakdugi you eat.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.569
Girls, you can eat whatever you want as much as you want.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.200
At the Gate One...

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:35.640
(Lawyer Park)

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.509
How did it go with Song Yi Heon?

00:25:39.609 --> 00:25:41.309
Were those students the assailants?

00:25:41.309 --> 00:25:42.980
One kid made a testimony.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.509
I told you not to let him walk free.

00:25:44.609 --> 00:25:45.650
Then that punk will...

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.049
He will put me in jail.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:50.849
Of course, he walks free. He's the victim.

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:52.660
I'm not going to defend them, so don't call me.

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.559
Gosh. I made myself clear...

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.130
and told them to get rid of any problems.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.130
The Dongsoo Gang and those school punks...

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.700
are both useless.

00:26:06.539 --> 00:26:09.410
Mi Kyung, which seolleongtang place are we going?

00:26:12.009 --> 00:26:14.240
I don't think she'll be able to find a place.

00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:21.079
Because she'll get busy soon.

00:26:28.359 --> 00:26:29.430
What's wrong with him?

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.289
Sir.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:36.029
The Chinese food is good around here, not seolleongtang.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.240
So, do you care to join me in having a bowl of jjamppong...

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.970
in a quiet room?

00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:47.339
You.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.809
You, Song Yi Heon.

00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:53.849
Instead of calling me, "Song Yi Heon,"

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.250
you should call me "Son," shouldn't you?

00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:58.420
Chairman Bae...

00:26:59.859 --> 00:27:00.859
of OK Construction.

00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:12.039
I can explain everything to Chairman Bae later.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.700
He'll understand me.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.210
He's not going to abandon me, is he?

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:18.380
Gosh. For goodness' sake!

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.480
When I saw you five years ago, you looked like a skinny beggar.

00:27:59.549 --> 00:28:01.680
Did you get a makeover somewhere?

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.819
I have always looked good in any clothes.

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:08.829
I guess you've never observed Yi Heon right.

00:28:10.289 --> 00:28:11.630
It sounds like you're blaming me.

00:28:12.099 --> 00:28:15.529
I think I've been nothing but good to you.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.200
"Jirokwima."

00:28:20.869 --> 00:28:21.940
What?

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.609
It's as if you're pointing at a deer and saying it is a horse.

00:28:25.579 --> 00:28:28.109
You're insisting that you're a father when you're not.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.210
Haven't you heard that Song Yi Heon had become...

00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:33.579
an assailant of school violence, that he called your company...

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.619
so many times, and that the police are looking...

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.019
for his father?

00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:42.660
Mi Kyung will handle them.

00:28:43.359 --> 00:28:44.430
Sir.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.329
Do you know what kind of person she is?

00:28:47.329 --> 00:28:49.170
She drugged my mother...

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.500
and made Yi Heon an assailant of school violence case.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.599
To take your legal wife's place once she dies,

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.039
she ordered gangsters to kidnap my mother.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.410
What are you talking about?

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.109
Sir, those are all lies!

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:04.950
It doesn't make sense.

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.480
How would I dare to hurt your son?

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.220
While you didn't play the part as a father,

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.519
Yi Heon lived in pain because of her.

00:29:14.589 --> 00:29:15.660
Sir.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:17.960
It's me, Mi Kyung.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.460
Since I was hired as your secretary,

00:29:20.099 --> 00:29:22.029
I worked for you for over ten years,

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.269
cleaning up the mess your wife, Song Mi Sun, and he made!

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.900
We've been great for many years.

00:29:28.609 --> 00:29:30.309
You said I was the only one you got.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.680
Seeing how much you got worked up, it's all true.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.289
If what you did with the kidnap and the drugs...

00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:44.450
are revealed in connection to the OK Construction...

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.289
Don't you know it's fatal?

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.900
Wrong place!

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.430
You kneel here.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.500
You have to apologize to me.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.769
What are you waiting for?

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:43.710
Goodness.

00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:45.779
It slipped.

00:30:49.289 --> 00:30:53.420
From now on, never come near Mother and Song Yi Heon.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.859
If not, I might really bury you in cement.

00:31:01.099 --> 00:31:02.099
You.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.299
You knew what Mi Kyung feared the most...

00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:08.099
was getting abandoned by me.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.210
So this is how you're getting back at her, isn't it?

00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:20.079
Yes. That's my boy.

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:23.119
I'll register you as my son.

00:31:28.259 --> 00:31:29.789
Did you sleep through the Korean class?

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.299
Don't you know the meaning of raising someone?

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.559
To raise is to grow it by taking care of it.

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.630
You help...

00:31:36.569 --> 00:31:39.569
a child so that he can grow into a good, truthful adult.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.839
That is the meaning of raising a child.

00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:45.980
If you were to abandon him once you don't need him,

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.210
you can't call yourself a parent.

00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:07.029
Right. Good job.

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:10.269
I think we're done here. You can leave first.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.339
I'll go home after I make a round.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.950
You guys should go home.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.910
I'll go home after I make a round.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.619
You stay here and help Deuk Pal.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.220
Take your time.

00:32:29.849 --> 00:32:33.259
Do you still read "alligator" as "arigato?"

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.660
Who...

00:32:36.859 --> 00:32:37.990
in the world are you?

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.630
Dong Soo. You already know everything.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.109
Did you get home safely?

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:59.220
I stopped by a park on my way home...

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.450
because it was nice and sunny.

00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:05.960
Chairman Bae said he'd register me as his son.

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:09.930
But I said no.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.960
Is it okay?

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.440
It caught me off guard, but I'm not in shock.

00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:25.609
It's nice to enjoy the sunlight after a long time.

00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:32.319
Actually, I...

00:33:33.579 --> 00:33:34.980
want to act.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:38.960
Do you think I can be an actress again?

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:43.430
Of course, you can. I'll help you.

00:33:46.329 --> 00:33:47.900
I have to take care of some stuff,

00:33:48.829 --> 00:33:49.900
so you should go to bed first.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:05.920
How does it feel to be back?

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:42.920
For me,

00:34:44.619 --> 00:34:45.960
Deuk Pal was always Grade 1.

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:14.119
Many things...

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.420
have changed.

00:35:17.019 --> 00:35:18.960
I sort out the bullies.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.159
I made friends.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.090
I punished Lee Mi Kyung and protected Mother.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.800
I think I've done everything I promised you.

00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:29.400
Aren't I amazing?

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.570
Don't talk about killing yourself anymore.

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.670
Live fully as Song Yi Heon.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.409
So that my efforts won't go to waste.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.679
You didn't get into college.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.909
That's...

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:45.750
because you came back too early.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.079
After deciding which college and major you want,

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.489
you should go to college.

00:35:53.019 --> 00:35:54.019
How much time...

00:35:54.989 --> 00:35:56.190
do we have?

00:35:59.559 --> 00:36:01.260
A week.

00:36:02.969 --> 00:36:04.099
After a week,

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.869
I'll return to my place, then.

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:13.510
I'm glad I can prepare myself for it.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.949
I'll get things in order and hand them over properly.

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:21.079
Don't forget that you're a senior. Focus on studying.

00:36:28.989 --> 00:36:30.630
(Dong Soo)

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.059
Why aren't you picking up?

00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:37.599
Are you avoiding him?

00:36:38.969 --> 00:36:40.769
Are you going to leave him without telling him?

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.739
Aren't you going to tell Se Kyung either?

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:53.119
If I try to explain it to Se Kyung, he'll know who I am.

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:55.719
Well...

00:36:56.119 --> 00:36:58.719
He doesn't have to feel sad because of an old guy, does he?

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:03.630
Even at this age,

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.199
it's hard to say goodbye.

00:37:13.269 --> 00:37:16.010
(Hansong High School)

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.940
Hey, are you all right?

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.010
I was worried about you.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.480
Did you hear it from Se Kyung?

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.650
Everything is okay now. Those boys will go to juvie.

00:37:34.059 --> 00:37:35.260
I know you had a tough time,

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.789
but Min Ji won't forgive you easily.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.699
You told her she had a big face.

00:37:41.699 --> 00:37:43.570
Do you know how hard it was to comfort her that day?

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:47.869
Wait. When did I say Min Ji had a big face?

00:37:48.539 --> 00:37:50.440
I just said Seol Hee's face was smaller.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.909
Hey, that's the same thing.

00:37:54.239 --> 00:37:56.780
Well, what I meant to say was...

00:37:57.449 --> 00:37:59.619
Though it's true that Seol Hee has a smaller face,

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.090
she's not my type.

00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:07.789
I like the ones with well-defined features Min Ji.

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:10.489
That's my type.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:16.530
Okay.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.730
I'll accept your apology because I'm awesome.

00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:22.239
We'll be watching you.

00:38:22.409 --> 00:38:24.170
You really should watch your mouth.

00:38:26.139 --> 00:38:27.179
Don't worry.

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:30.250
A proper high school student who speaks...

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:32.579
much nicely will be here.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.349
- What is he talking about? - Whatever.

00:38:46.829 --> 00:38:48.960
Hey, why didn't you answer my calls?

00:38:49.699 --> 00:38:51.469
Sorry, I was all over the place.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:53.239
What happened?

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.510
This isn't the right place to talk about it.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:58.170
Come.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.090
Hey. You're possessed, aren't you?

00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:18.889
I mean you look the same.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.730
The DNA test result also said you were Song Yi Heon.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.500
Your soul went into Yi Heon's body, didn't it?

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.969
Hey, how would I know?

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.480
I didn't know what happened to me either.

00:39:33.639 --> 00:39:36.780
So, I'm just going with the flow right now.

00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:43.190
Hey. The teacher called me.

00:39:43.789 --> 00:39:44.849
I should get going.

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.530
Hey.

00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:54.699
(For using violence against classmate, 5 seniors are expelled.)

00:39:54.699 --> 00:39:57.269
- They deserve to be expelled. - They're finally kicked out.

00:39:57.469 --> 00:39:59.030
What they did calls for an expulsion.

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:00.840
I wanted them to be expelled.

00:40:16.119 --> 00:40:17.420
Aren't you going to apologize to me?

00:40:26.199 --> 00:40:27.199
Actually,

00:40:29.969 --> 00:40:30.969
for spreading...

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:33.340
the rumour that you bullied others,

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.400
and for telling Se Kyung's father about you,

00:40:38.039 --> 00:40:39.940
I wanted to apologize, but I couldn't get the chance.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.550
I'm sorry about everything.

00:40:45.449 --> 00:40:46.579
Take your phone out.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.190
Erase Se Kyung's father's number...

00:40:51.389 --> 00:40:52.860
and apologize to Se Kyung too.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:57.090
(Se Kyung's father)

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:58.159
(Do you want to move this contact to trash?)

00:40:59.929 --> 00:41:02.630
Be nice to Se Kyung when I'm gone.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:04.769
Don't treat him like a servant.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:06.739
Be sincerely nice to him...

00:41:07.599 --> 00:41:08.670
as his friend.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.679
Can I be friends with you too?

00:41:20.519 --> 00:41:21.619
Forget it.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.719
You and Yi Heon don't have the same vibe.

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:34.300
Now, you can order everything you want.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.329
Should we get a couple's combo?

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.300
(A couple's combo)

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.340
Yes. Sure.

00:41:41.239 --> 00:41:42.610
One couple's combo, please.

00:41:44.739 --> 00:41:45.769
Please enjoy.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.289
If we're having a couple's combo,

00:41:59.389 --> 00:42:00.590
does it make us a couple?

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.530
No. You can order it when you're not a couple.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.260
I'm saying that I have feelings for you.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.070
What?

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.050
Thank you.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.449
Can you...

00:42:29.289 --> 00:42:31.289
wait for two days?

00:42:32.219 --> 00:42:33.659
I'll give you an answer in two days.

00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:36.559
In two days?

00:42:43.099 --> 00:42:44.800
Okay. I'll wait, then.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.170
How could you...

00:42:48.869 --> 00:42:50.440
pass along such a thing to me?

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.780
I'm not passing along anything. The decision was yours to take.

00:42:56.079 --> 00:42:58.880
Going out with a girlfriend and making new friends.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.480
They are all for you to decide.

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:06.420
It's because it's your life.

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:10.760
Tomorrow is your last day.

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:14.230
Shouldn't you spend the last day with Se Kyung?

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:17.099
He must be waiting for you to tell him the truth.

00:43:19.699 --> 00:43:20.769
It'll be better...

00:43:22.769 --> 00:43:23.769
if he doesn't know.

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:34.119
(Dong Soo)

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.900
What time did you get in last night?

00:43:57.039 --> 00:43:58.039
I had a part-time job.

00:43:58.269 --> 00:43:59.539
A part-time job? You're a high school senior.

00:43:59.909 --> 00:44:01.340
Are you out of your mind?

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:05.079
I can still get into a good college even if I have to work part-time.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:08.849
And I get the feeling I must be financially independent from you,

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:11.489
so you will come to acknowledge my independence sooner.

00:44:11.489 --> 00:44:12.489
Acknowledge?

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:15.559
Do you really expect me to acknowledge your independence...

00:44:16.059 --> 00:44:18.030
when you're still friends with that lowlife?

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.929
He's not a lowlife. His name is Song Yi Heon.

00:44:24.199 --> 00:44:26.739
Besides, he's my best friend.

00:44:26.739 --> 00:44:28.239
Don't speak badly of him.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:36.280
I'm going to work.

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:09.510
I'm here to apologize.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:16.989
I didn't know you were capable of that.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:20.519
Song Yi Heon told me to apologize to you.

00:45:22.559 --> 00:45:24.159
He said I should genuinely treat you like a friend,

00:45:24.159 --> 00:45:25.389
instead of trying to use you.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.329
I really want to remain friends with you.

00:45:31.469 --> 00:45:32.500
I'll think about it.

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:38.210
By the way, it's about Song Yi Heon.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.510
What about him?

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.510
Is he transferring to another school?

00:45:44.849 --> 00:45:45.849
Transfer?

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.719
I didn't think much of it then.

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:51.789
But he asked me to take care of you...

00:45:52.619 --> 00:45:53.619
once he was gone.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.349
What's wrong?

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:19.309
Are you back?

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.889
Is Yi Heon back?

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:30.860
He came back, but you didn't tell me on purpose. Isn't that it?

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:32.960
When you knew how worried I had been!

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:36.699
Let's go.

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:40.769
I'll give you the answers to all of your questions.

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.519
What are we doing here?

00:46:56.489 --> 00:46:57.989
You said you would give me answers.

00:46:57.989 --> 00:47:00.059
(The late Kim Deuk Pal)

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.389
That's me.

00:47:05.059 --> 00:47:06.429
(The late Kim Deuk Pal)

00:47:06.429 --> 00:47:07.659
"Kim Deuk Pal."

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:09.929
You were born in 1977.

00:47:12.969 --> 00:47:14.300
Yes, I'm dead.

00:47:15.039 --> 00:47:16.239
I tried to save Song Yi Heon...

00:47:16.239 --> 00:47:17.969
when he jumped off the pedestrian overpass.

00:47:18.739 --> 00:47:21.110
I think that's when my spirit went into Song Yi Heon's body.

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:23.809
I guess it's similar to a spirit...

00:47:24.679 --> 00:47:25.909
taking over a body.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:35.760
So physically, you're dead.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.329
But once Yi Heon's spirit comes back,

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:41.630
you have no place to go.

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:43.530
I don't.

00:47:44.599 --> 00:47:46.030
Naturally, I'll die.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.300
That's why I couldn't tell you.

00:47:49.769 --> 00:47:51.269
I thought that once Yi Heon came back,

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:54.440
the joy of seeing your friend again...

00:47:54.809 --> 00:47:56.980
might be able to make the sadness go away...

00:47:58.409 --> 00:47:59.619
because we would look the same.

00:48:01.619 --> 00:48:03.489
Then why are you telling me the truth now?

00:48:03.719 --> 00:48:05.519
You would have definitely tried something...

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:07.519
after hearing everything from Jae Hoon.

00:48:08.019 --> 00:48:11.030
You would have probably tried to verify that the real Yi Heon...

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.389
came back.

00:48:15.199 --> 00:48:16.199
Just like now.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:19.639
Just like now?

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:24.239
Song Yi Heon is back.

00:48:54.869 --> 00:48:55.969
Are you really...

00:48:57.239 --> 00:48:58.269
Yi Heon?

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:06.010
Can Se Kyung also see his spirit?

00:49:07.119 --> 00:49:08.280
(Emergency transport)

00:49:23.429 --> 00:49:24.500
That's why on the bus...

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:07.809
I'm craving a shot of soju on a day like today.

00:50:35.099 --> 00:50:36.170
My dear nephew.

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:39.539
Why have you been dodging our calls lately?

00:50:39.539 --> 00:50:40.679
He wanted to come and see you,

00:50:40.679 --> 00:50:42.440
but I stopped him because I thought you were studying for your exam.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.510
I told him that you would call him once the exam was over.

00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:47.349
But funny running into you here.

00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:48.349
We must have been...

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.650
on the same "website."

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:51.719
Gosh.

00:50:52.619 --> 00:50:53.889
You mean "on the same page."

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.989
Don't you remember? Our boss told us to study.

00:50:59.829 --> 00:51:03.300
"On the same page."

00:51:04.699 --> 00:51:05.969
Let's go and have soju.

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:14.579
Sir. Is it okay for a student to drink soju, though?

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:19.820
Let's go.

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.050
I only brought two bottles.

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:34.230
That night,

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:38.929
you decided to jump off the pedestrian overpass.

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.599
That's all my fault.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.809
I didn't want to get hurt.

00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:49.949
So I pushed you to the overpass.

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:53.820
I sincerely want to apologize to you.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.420
I'm really scared.

00:51:58.289 --> 00:51:59.389
I feel suffocated.

00:52:02.159 --> 00:52:03.730
Could you help me?

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:06.599
I know you can help me.

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.030
Why should I get involved? This is your problem.

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:14.539
Tell your parents.

00:52:14.539 --> 00:52:16.070
Or if you can't, transfer to another school.

00:52:17.469 --> 00:52:20.510
No. Transferring to a new school won't solve anything.

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:24.909
I made up my mind.

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:28.119
I'll report them to the school violence committee.

00:52:28.219 --> 00:52:29.449
I'll also report them to the police.

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:33.960
So I'll make Jae Min and his friends face criminal punishment.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:34.989
So...

00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:37.960
could you tell your father?

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:39.730
Your father is a prosecutor.

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:43.570
No.

00:52:44.969 --> 00:52:47.269
To tell you the truth, I was angry when I saw you that night.

00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:49.909
"Why can't he fight back?"

00:52:51.969 --> 00:52:54.139
"I helped him. But why is he being so pathetic?"

00:52:55.239 --> 00:52:58.510
Then I realized that I couldn't fight back to my dad just like you.

00:53:01.449 --> 00:53:03.389
Seeing you getting beaten up, unable to fight back...

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:05.949
reminded me of myself.

00:53:09.489 --> 00:53:10.829
I think that made me angry.

00:53:12.329 --> 00:53:13.329
Then...

00:53:14.659 --> 00:53:17.300
I will expose your true nature to other people.

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:20.670
You are kind to them.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:22.099
You act cheerful and smile at them.

00:53:22.869 --> 00:53:23.869
But that's all fake.

00:53:28.539 --> 00:53:30.150
What's your point?

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.050
When Jae Hoon broke his ankle in the gym that day,

00:53:33.679 --> 00:53:35.480
you were the first one to see him. I'm sure of it.

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.949
But you acted as if you didn't see that.

00:53:37.949 --> 00:53:40.360
Jae Hoon might think of you as a true friend.

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.519
But you don't.

00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:46.429
You just despise and hate people.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:48.960
That's who you are.

00:53:50.969 --> 00:53:54.070
No one had seen my worst side except for you.

00:53:56.139 --> 00:53:59.070
For the first time, I felt like I was naked.

00:54:00.639 --> 00:54:03.110
So I might have been harsher on you than I wanted to.

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:05.010
I'm sorry.

00:54:06.679 --> 00:54:07.849
No.

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:09.989
I was cruel to you that night too.

00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:15.289
But still. I shouldn't have been mean to you...

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.789
when you were desperately asking for my help.

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.099
Please help me.

00:54:25.199 --> 00:54:27.000
I'm begging you.

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.469
If you tell your father,

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:32.739
they might...

00:54:33.809 --> 00:54:35.309
confess what they've done.

00:54:37.909 --> 00:54:39.380
When I reported them for school violence,

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.880
you said they didn't bully you.

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:43.389
Part of it is your fault.

00:54:43.849 --> 00:54:45.989
No. It's all your fault.

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:52.190
Se Kyung.

00:55:55.119 --> 00:55:56.559
This isn't your fault.

00:55:58.929 --> 00:56:02.699
It would have been great if I could fight back...

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:06.329
just like Mr. Kim Deuk Pal or the new you.

00:56:08.099 --> 00:56:09.239
Facing my problem head-on...

00:56:10.409 --> 00:56:11.969
would have been nice even if I failed.

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:16.579
Back then, I had no idea what I was supposed to do.

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:21.280
But now, I know.

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:23.920
I learned it from Yi Heon.

00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:27.760
I'll be the one helping you, not my father.

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:31.190
And I'll be your true friend.

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:34.900
Yes.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.130
Don't let your father hurt you anymore.

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:40.239
Hang in there.

00:56:43.039 --> 00:56:44.369
I forgive you.

00:56:45.539 --> 00:56:48.679
No. I've already forgiven you.

00:56:53.849 --> 00:56:56.079
Thank you for telling me that you would be...

00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:58.849
my friend.

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:24.050
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:25.250
"I'm Deuk Pal."

00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:27.349
"I'm your boss."

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.219
Why didn't you tell me?

00:57:31.289 --> 00:57:33.150
I'm already dead.

00:57:35.159 --> 00:57:36.690
I didn't want there to be a second funeral...

00:57:37.559 --> 00:57:38.829
for my dead spirit.

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.130
That would have been too cruel for you guys.

00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:11.730
Dong Soo.

00:58:15.159 --> 00:58:17.070
Thank you for staying loyal to me...

00:58:18.329 --> 00:58:19.329
for all these years.

00:58:28.909 --> 00:58:29.980
I was happy...

00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:34.050
that I got to work under you, sir.

00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:38.820
In whatever body or form you come back,

00:58:41.719 --> 00:58:43.219
I will never forget you.

00:59:12.719 --> 00:59:13.789
You should go now.

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:16.320
You must go first for me to leave at peace.

00:59:19.559 --> 00:59:20.559
Out of...

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:24.829
all the people I've met, you were the most admirable friend...

00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:27.170
and adult.

00:59:28.469 --> 00:59:30.739
A friend I wish I had by my side.

00:59:33.639 --> 00:59:34.679
A dear friend like that.

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:39.880
I was happy that you were my friend too.

00:59:40.719 --> 00:59:43.949
You can be a much better adult than me.

00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:47.789
Don't doubt yourself and keep pushing forward.

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:53.929
Your parents must be waiting.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.389
Sir, you should go back.

01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:28.090
Go back where?

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.329
You know where to go.

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:35.260
I don't have any desires left in this life.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.369
When I jumped off the pedestrian overpass,

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:40.739
I had let go of everything.

01:01:41.869 --> 01:01:42.900
But still.

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:45.139
I can't steal your life.

01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:48.239
I'm tired.

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:52.650
I don't have any energy left to live my life.

01:01:54.219 --> 01:01:55.949
But thanks to you,

01:01:57.119 --> 01:01:59.389
I was happy to see a smile on my face.

01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:06.630
If someone could be happy in my body,

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.269
that would be enough to make me happy.

01:02:58.550 --> 01:02:59.809
- Hello. - Hello.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.250
- Hello. - Hello.

01:03:07.019 --> 01:03:08.960
You really are the school president.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.489
You are still popular.

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.130
What are you still doing here?

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.500
We go to the same school.

01:03:15.929 --> 01:03:17.670
Isn't it natural to run into each other?

01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:20.869
No. Wasn't your first period your major class?

01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:25.170
I was watching the soccer game late last night. So I overslept.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.239
It's not too late. Attend the class now.

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.440
Hey, it's already too late.

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:33.150
How could you still act like my tutor even in college?

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:37.349
This guy completely changed now that he's in college.

01:03:37.889 --> 01:03:40.690
Yi Heon should have stayed, not you.

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:50.030
Hey, do you want to go on a group blind date?

01:03:50.429 --> 01:03:51.730
I need to study for my exam.

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:53.869
Hey. Youth is there to be enjoyed.

01:03:54.199 --> 01:03:56.940
That old saying only worked when you went to school, old man.

01:03:57.039 --> 01:03:58.110
Kids these days are busy...

01:03:58.110 --> 01:03:59.469
learning foreign languages and improving their skill set.

01:03:59.469 --> 01:04:01.239
How come you're the only one, taking it easy, old man?

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:05.550
Hey, let's go to Jong Cheol's cafe and study there.

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:07.380
We can have a cup of coffee.

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.550
You want to hang out with the uncles again, don't you?

01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:10.619
Hang out with them?

01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:12.449
They want to take the GED,

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:14.389
so I'm going there to help them. You know?

01:04:14.719 --> 01:04:15.760
Gosh.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.559
- Do you want to come with me? - Forget it.

01:04:18.559 --> 01:04:19.659
Come on. Let's go.

01:04:19.659 --> 01:04:22.030
- Come with me. Let's go. - I have to study.

01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:25.670
Hey. Why don't we go and have makgeolli?

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:27.099
We can go to a bar in front of the school.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.369
How about makgeolli? Yes?

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:34.340
(Thank you for watching High School Return of a Gangster.)
