(High School Return of a Gangster)

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,929
Hey, let's take a rest from the study room today.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,140
- Where are you going? - There's someone I have to meet.

9
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,310
Se Kyung. You're going to the study room. Right?

10
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,479
I'm heading home now. But the study room is on the way.

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,880
Do you want me to give you a ride?

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,648
I haven't been able to exercise lately.

13
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:47,820
I think walking will be better.

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,100
Let go of me!

15
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,130
Yi Heon... Song Yi Heon!

16
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,790
You've reached an emergency call centre.

17
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,120
I think my friend just got abducted by gangsters.

18
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,629
Please help him now!

19
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,959
Gangsters?

20
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,930
Where was he abducted?

21
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,599
It's in front of Hansong High School.

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,930
If the police get involved,

23
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,269
Yi Heon's life will change drastically.

24
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:43,540
That won't be good for Yi Heon at all.

25
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,510
I think my friend pulled a prank on me.

26
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,620
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,689
(Father)

(High School Return of a Gangster)

(Episode 5)

30
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,849
Why, you...

31
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,060
Dong Soo.

32
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,400
What is all this?

33
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,770
Sir.

34
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,799
He's the kid who impersonated Boss Deuk Pal...

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,270
at the sauna the other day.

36
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:48,609
(Song Yi Heon)

37
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,639
"Song Yi Heon?"

38
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,840
No wonder your name sounded familiar.

39
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,680
You're the kid, responsible for Boss Deuk Pal's death.

40
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,550
What?

41
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,490
It's like he had a makeover.

42
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,089
You scumbag.

43
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,418
You survived at the expense of Boss Deuk Pal.

44
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:04,860
How dare you impersonate Boss Deuk Pal?

45
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,089
Did Lee Mi Kyung order you to abduct me...

46
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,560
after your horrible failure to abduct my mother?

47
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:12,900
Does Boss Chil Sung know...

48
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,830
what you're up to?

49
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,639
Don't tell me...

50
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,068
you turned against him.

51
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,110
How dare you bring up Boss Chil Sung?

52
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,879
You little...

53
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,780
Hey, he's a high school kid.

54
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,270
How could you let a high schooler beat you up like this?

55
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,389
Why can't I fling you down?

56
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,519
Did you gain weight?

57
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,490
That's a sensitive topic. Why are you asking me that? Darn it.

58
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,839
Weight classes matter in fighting. You know?

59
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:43,689
Where did you go?

60
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,620
Didn't I tell you?

61
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:47,789
You guys are being punished right now.

62
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,489
I don't know why Yi Heon decided not to call...

63
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,528
the disciplinary committee for school violence.

64
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:53,769
But you guys still beat up your friend and bullied him.

65
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,800
I won't let this kind of behaviour slide.

66
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,939
Make sure to clean thoroughly before you go home.

67
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,268
If you don't, I'll get you all suspended...

68
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:02,339
at the school meeting.

69
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:17,720
What?

70
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,019
Did you guys go out to smoke without me?

71
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,160
I heard...

72
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,329
the whole gang was going to this place.

73
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,300
You know where this place is, right?

74
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,339
(27 Dahae-ro 10-gil, Hyeonnam-dong)

75
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,309
(27 Dahae-ro 10-gil)

76
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,980
- Why here? - Why do you think?

77
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,148
Since you chickened out, they couldn't finish the job.

78
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:42,149
So they're going back.

79
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,750
That's their business.

80
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,689
I'm done working with them now.

81
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,050
So mind your own business.

82
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,759
I don't think that's how they see it.

83
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,829
They told us to take you to the Sinho Hotel.

84
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,799
Jae Min. What on earth did you do that day?

85
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,199
Why do they have it out for you?

86
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,138
I've been hanging with you guys for a long time.

87
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,370
How could you treat me like a bill man?

88
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:07,569
What?

89
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,009
Bill? What? What's he talking about?

90
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,479
I think he means "villain."

91
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,138
- "Villain?" - I see. He meant "villain."

92
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,148
It's "villain." Seriously.

93
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:16,250
He's ridiculous.

94
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,620
- Hey. - He's saying something.

95
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,980
Shouldn't you guys side with me?

96
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,189
What?

97
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,819
Don't come near me.

98
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,129
Hitting me in the face is a cheap move, you jerk.

99
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,970
Get him!

100
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,920
If you don't do anything,

101
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,419
bad guys become more powerful,

102
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,949
and the world becomes a worse place.

103
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,420
That's the way of the world.

104
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,829
You're done with school, right?

105
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:08,730
Stop going to the study room now.

106
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,439
I found a tutor who can help you during that time.

107
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,139
I'm on my way to pick you up.

108
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,810
I'll arrive in five minutes.

109
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Let go of me!

110
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:41,029
What are you doing? Come on.

111
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:48,810
Darn it.

112
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,279
I'm certain he's around here.

113
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:52,939
Hey.

114
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,850
This is the only place he can hide around the school.

115
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,050
Hey, Do Ji Hwan. You go that way.

116
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,649
- You three. Go that way. - Okay.

117
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,420
If we bring Jae Min to the gang, they will give us work, right?

118
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,819
Of course.

119
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,859
Hey, let's catch that jerk and join the Dongsoo Gang.

120
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,888
Split up.

121
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,060
- Let's go. - Let's go.

122
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,759
Gosh.

123
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:23,839
What are you? A dog?

124
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,839
I don't want to do this with you either.

125
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,310
Those jerks.

126
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,148
I trusted them to be my friends.

127
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:32,778
But they betrayed me and treated me like a bill man.

128
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:33,820
You mean "villain."

129
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,120
Yes. Because he gets you like the hidden charges.

130
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,320
I have a really bad headache.

131
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,589
Unless there's a reason you must talk to me,

132
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,860
why don't you ask them...

133
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,929
how they'll want to "charge" you.

134
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,429
Hey, Byung Chul.

135
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,370
Jae Min has a question for you.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,669
I need to talk to you. There's something you must know.

137
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:52,340
The gangsters are going to meet up at Song Yi Heon's house.

138
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,109
I think they'll try to abduct Song Yi Heon's mother again.

139
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,869
What? They'll abduct Yi Heon's mother...

140
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,509
while keeping him away against his will?

141
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,379
What are you talking about? They have Song Yi Heon?

142
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,250
Song Yi Heon is probably locked up at the Sinho Hotel.

143
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,960
They told my friends to bring me there too.

144
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,589
You must know where in the hotel Yi Heon must be, right?

145
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,829
I heard their office and fitness training centre were...

146
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,799
across the entrance of the nightclub.

147
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,860
If they have him, he should be somewhere there.

148
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,870
Can you go and help him?

149
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,969
His mother can't be abducted again.

150
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,199
Yi Heon didn't want to report it to the police,

151
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,239
so the report was never filed.

152
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,268
- If we hurry and help him... - Are you crazy?

153
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,779
They are grown men.

154
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,378
They're adults who can give us a severe beatdown.

155
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,449
So you can't do anything?

156
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,210
Come on. They are gangsters.

157
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,349
What do you think you can do against those gangsters?

158
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,690
If you want to die, do it alone.

159
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:42,350
Don't drag me into this. Darn it.

160
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,919
You coward.

161
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,158
- What? - You really are a piece of trash.

162
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,490
You scumbag.

163
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,359
Don't talk like you're any different.

164
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,569
You couldn't do anything either.

165
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,829
You saw them take Song Yi Heon,

166
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,440
but you didn't do anything to help him.

167
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:00,940
Oh, right. You can call your dad.

168
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,769
People put you on a pedestal by calling you the son of a prosecutor.

169
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,480
You used to brag about that.

170
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,110
This is the perfect chance to use your connection,

171
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,850
although it's not something you earned by yourself.

172
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,590
Sure. I'll go then.

173
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,589
Hey, where are you going?

174
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,629
Will you really go there?

175
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:29,769
- Do you want me to bite you again? - Gosh, stop with the biting thing.

176
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,269
Are you really a dog?

177
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,070
Do you have a mad cow disease or something?

178
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,169
The mad cow disease makes cows foam around their mouths and pass out.

179
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:39,778
When dogs bite people with foamy discharge...

180
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,648
I get it. It's called the ray bees.

181
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:42,779
Rabies.

182
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,120
Gosh.

183
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:48,949
I can't stand this. This is ridiculous.

184
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,089
You used to ignore and look down on Song Yi Heon.

185
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,659
Why are you suddenly acting like his best friend?

186
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:54,590
Hey, isn't it obvious?

187
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,028
- It's all because of you. - What?

188
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:59,829
I would hate to live my life as a coward like you.

189
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,768
Besides, he worked so hard to protect all this.

190
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:03,299
I can't let his effort go to waste.

191
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,240
That way, Song Yi Heon will be able to come back.

192
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,570
So I'll do whatever it takes.

193
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,539
Wait. "Whatever?"

194
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,350
Hey, are you going to call the police too?

195
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,610
What if I do?

196
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,580
Are you scared you'll be arrested too?

197
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,990
Even at this moment, you're only worried about yourself.

198
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,789
You're unsalvageable.

199
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,329
Byung Chul. Jae Min wants to see you.

200
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,100
Hey! You jerk.

201
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,200
Darn it. Come on.

202
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,679
Where did you learn to fight like that?

203
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,990
I didn't learn anything.

204
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,190
I was born with this talent.

205
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:07,470
Do you have nothing to fear?

206
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:09,899
Or do you not know what fear is?

207
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,269
I should be asking you that. Have you lost your mind?

208
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:16,409
What were you going to do with my mother?

209
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,179
I'm going to put her in the psychiatric facility.

210
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,909
How could you call yourself a gangster?

211
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,678
Don't you have any pride as a member of the Chilsung Gang?

212
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,690
Did you form your own gang to do what lowlifes do?

213
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,990
You don't know anything. How dare you talk to me like that?

214
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,820
When Kim Deuk Pal died,

215
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,759
you must've thought that was your chance.

216
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,628
- What? - Kim Deuk Pal went...

217
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,359
out of the picture at the perfect time.

218
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,330
I bet you could easily oust Boss Chil Sung too.

219
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:46,799
Do you have a death wish?

220
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,538
You grabbed Song Yi Heon by the collar...

221
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:51,509
and dragged him to the funeral hall.

222
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,110
Was that all an act?

223
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,450
You left a memo at the columbarium.

224
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,148
Was that part of your act too?

225
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:02,450
(Boss Deuk Pal, I won't forget you. Dong Soo)

226
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,909
Choi Se Kyung.

227
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,340
What are you doing here?

228
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,279
Never mind. Have you seen Hong Jae Min?

229
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:30,279
I heard his voice.

230
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,250
That way.

231
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,289
Darn it.

232
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:41,360
Taxi.

233
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,039
Where are you right now?

234
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,700
Why aren't you coming out?

235
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,168
Are you really at school?

236
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,409
Or did you sneak out to play hooky or something?

237
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,279
(Housekeeper)

238
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,589
Hello, ma'am. This is Se Kyung, Yi Heon's friend.

239
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,950
You're answering his phone.

240
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,489
By the way, is Yi Heon with you?

241
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,819
His mother keeps asking me to go out and buy alcohol.

242
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,230
Don't leave the house. Please stay home.

243
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,628
Is Mr. Kim with you?

244
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:19,129
Yes. Wait.

245
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,569
Hello.

246
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,200
The house is protected by a security firm, right?

247
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,740
(Father)

248
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,508
Mr. Yi Heon already dispatched some guards...

249
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:30,509
when his mother was discharged.

250
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,210
Ask the firm to dispatch all the bodyguards they have.

251
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,629
(Se Kyung)

252
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,080
Given your combat skills,

253
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,080
you used to know Boss Deuk Pal. Right?

254
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,918
That's why he died, trying to save your life.

255
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,120
You must know our names...

256
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,690
and about our gang because he told you.

257
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,789
That must have been why...

258
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,620
you were acting so strange at the funeral. Right?

259
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,899
Then you must have heard about me too.

260
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,230
It wasn't an act.

261
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:30,269
Boss Deuk Pal was my family.

262
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,669
Then tell me.

263
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,470
Where's Boss Chil Sung?

264
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,480
Did you really oust him? Did you kill him?

265
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,548
He's not dead.

266
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:47,850
I just couldn't serve him.

267
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,819
After Boss Deuk Pal passed away,

268
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,119
the Rotary Gang, the Sangduk Gang, and the Kwangsoo Gang...

269
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,820
joined hands and attacked the Chilsung Gang.

270
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,690
Boss Chil Sung got a severe injury and was hospitalized.

271
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,330
Then he left by himself.

272
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,928
I've been asking around to find his whereabouts.

273
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:03,099
I couldn't use the name, the Chilsung Gang, without him.

274
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,570
That's why we became the Dongsoo Gang.

275
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,610
Stop doing someone's dirty work.

276
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,549
Disband...

277
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,750
the Dongsoo Gang.

278
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:27,789
Gosh.

279
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,230
You sound like a gangster, not me.

280
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,330
Gosh. You're something else.

281
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:34,200
Answer me this.

282
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:36,870
Did you think I would do that...

283
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,299
just because you told me to?

284
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,139
(Jong Cheol)

285
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:54,079
Sir.

286
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,090
You jerk.

287
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,149
Come on.

288
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,090
I'm in front of his house.

289
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:01,960
Something is off.

290
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,189
The security is very tight.

291
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,500
Don't let them see you.

292
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,430
Just wait for my green light in hiding.

293
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,210
You withdrew the report.

294
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,710
Instead of getting the cops involved, you hired more bodyguards.

295
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,809
You must have something to hide too.

296
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,519
There's a good reason behind it.

297
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,049
There are some things I must protect.

298
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,789
Whatever you're trying to protect,

299
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,490
you won't succeed with mere bodyguards.

300
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,098
They will be slacking off by tomorrow morning,

301
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,430
half of them asleep and half of them gone.

302
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,740
Do you think I'll be staying still?

303
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:51,440
Do you think I won't be able to manage a high school kid?

304
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,140
I don't think you are.

305
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,819
If we send Song Mi Sun to the mental hospital,

306
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,490
what do we do about the kid?

307
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:04,789
Study-abroad.

308
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,618
- "Study-abroad?" - No matter how insufficient he is,

309
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,990
he's still Chairman Bae's blood relation.

310
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,259
He's the only son among all his wives.

311
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:17,500
That's why he's allowed a house, car, and even a credit card,

312
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:20,140
to live comfortably.

313
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,210
That's why...

314
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,140
he can't ever be sick or die.

315
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,849
Instead, we will send him to study abroad in a warm country.

316
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,990
Then he will be out of my reach.

317
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,589
Then I'll be thought of as a competent secretary,

318
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:41,059
who kept him safe and even sent him abroad to study.

319
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,630
Alright.

320
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,069
Among the warm countries,

321
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:53,200
there must be a place that has many accidents and is allowed guns.

322
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,109
That woman completely misjudged you

323
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,720
Do you know which country...

324
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,619
likes violence the most?

325
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,019
What are you talking about?

326
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,559
Chile.

327
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,029
Are you...

328
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:18,529
goofing around because you want to be hit?

329
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,700
Let's talk with our fists like gangsters do.

330
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Bring it.

331
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,890
What are you doing here?

332
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:51,299
I heard that...

333
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:54,160
- he was held captive here. - "Held?"

334
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,470
Did you lure me here on purpose?

335
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,740
If I came here,

336
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,109
I knew you would follow me.

337
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,509
With you here,

338
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:12,049
I thought I could save my friend without calling the police.

339
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,319
"Friend?"

340
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,289
Is that "friend" Song Yi Heon?

341
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,589
When I came home with bruises on my face a few days ago,

342
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,089
it was because I was trying to save his mother from getting abducted.

343
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,960
That's how I got hit by the gangsters.

344
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,599
But those guys took Yi Heon.

345
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,970
Yi Heon is being held by gangsters right now.

346
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,230
Why would you interfere in that kid's business?

347
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:34,199
I told you to pick your friends wisely.

348
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,210
Let's go.

349
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,670
Those guys kidnap people.

350
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,880
He could really be in danger.

351
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,150
Please help him.

352
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:49,019
Do you think...

353
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,619
you can beat me?

354
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:55,160
Your anterior cruciate ligament.

355
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,700
You tore it when you were collecting money with Jong Cheol.

356
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,669
- What? - You didn't even realize it...

357
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,170
and went around all day,

358
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,500
so you got to the hospital late at night.

359
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:09,509
How did you...

360
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,038
Only Jong Cheol and Boss Deuk Pal know about that.

361
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,909
Even after the surgery, you were busy with the gang...

362
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,210
that you didn't get to rehabilitate properly.

363
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:20,650
I know that you can't stand on one leg.

364
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:26,319
Who are you?

365
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,460
Someone who knows your weakness very well.

366
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:37,900
I'm going to move so that the leg has to bear your weight...

367
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:41,509
and shatter your knee at the crucial moment.

368
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,170
So that you can't ever walk again.

369
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,910
I don't want to go that far either.

370
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,079
So...

371
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,380
break up the Dongsoo Gang...

372
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,650
and bring Lee Mi Kyung in front of me.

373
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,588
Once you break up the gang, I will support you...

374
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:01,019
so that you can open up an eel restaurant in your hometown.

375
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,960
I can get that much from Chairman Bae.

376
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:07,329
If you don't break it up within that time,

377
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,069
it will be broken up with your hands empty.

378
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,539
Understand?

379
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,690
Do you still read "alligator" as "arigato?"

380
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,289
Take it seriously, man.

381
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,759
Put in your everything, like making a needle out of an iron ball.

382
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,429
There's an idiom, "Machuljeo."

383
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,598
It means anything is possible...

384
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:44,069
no matter how hard it may be as long as you give it a try.

385
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,268
So let's keep on trying hard. Okay?

386
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:49,769
Yes, sir. So this idiom, "Machuljeo," must mean...

387
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,039
"Hey, man. Keep chewing on a bone." Or something like that.

388
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,680
Who...

389
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:57,880
in the world are you?

390
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,150
I do as I say.

391
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,490
I'm sure you know that the best.

392
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,210
Are you okay? Are you sure you're not hurt?

393
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,710
I'm fine.

394
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,980
How did you know where I was?

395
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,549
I saw you getting taken.

396
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:35,750
Hong Jae Min told me you would be here.

397
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,190
Right.

398
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,960
I found this.

399
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:46,230
Are you Se Kyung's father?

400
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,869
I guess Se Kyung was very worried...

401
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,039
for you to come here with him.

402
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:54,970
I'm very sorry to have troubled you.

403
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,869
You wait here.

404
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,410
Yes, sir.

405
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,220
How did you get out?

406
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,589
I couldn't even report it because they said not to.

407
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,490
I was very worried.

408
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,089
Is that why you brought your prosecutor father?

409
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,930
(Chief Prosecutor, Choi Myung Hyun)

410
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:23,299
"Chief Prosecutor?"

411
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,769
I'm looking into...

412
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,940
the Wonha Construction corruption case these days.

413
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,910
But I saw that the gangsters from this area were involved.

414
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:34,980
The Ddongsoo Gang or something.

415
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,250
We don't know anything about Wonha Construction.

416
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,119
Oh, is that so?

417
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,019
Did I get that mixed up?

418
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,249
Prosecutor.

419
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,960
Whatever you're trying to get out of me, it won't work.

420
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:48,490
Just say what you came here for.

421
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,029
Then...

422
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,829
while I try to remember if it was the Ddongsoo Gang,

423
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:57,670
should we talk about the boys you sent to Song Yi Heon's house?

424
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:01,539
If you get sent to the prosecution this way,

425
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:04,670
your establishments will be taken.

426
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,910
Then, I think it will be over for you and your gang.

427
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,269
Withdraw.

428
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:34,368
Boss, you know that we have to take care of this properly...

429
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:36,739
in order to bring Boss Chil Sung.

430
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,809
Withdraw!

431
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,119
You don't seem to be related,

432
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:48,420
so how did a high school kid...

433
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,819
make you take action?

434
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,259
What is your relation...

435
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,390
with Song Yi Heon?

436
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,599
Nothing.

437
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,230
And I'm trying not to leave such a thing.

438
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,970
You're late.

439
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:39,470
Is something wrong?

440
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:42,509
Your mother kept wanting to go out,

441
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,039
so I had a hard time.

442
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,740
- And now? - She took medicine and is asleep.

443
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,680
But why did you call so many bodyguards?

444
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,450
The men were all over the place,

445
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,450
so she felt even more uneasy.

446
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,588
Wasn't it Mr. Kim who called them?

447
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:00,419
Se Kyung told me to call them.

448
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,289
Wasn't it you who requested them?

449
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,160
Well, yes. I did.

450
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,699
Were you worried about your mother?

451
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,598
Gosh, what a nice son.

452
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,598
I hope she realizes.

453
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,869
She's always high on her medication, breaking everything.

454
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:20,309
I'm going to call it a night. Go on and rest.

455
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:21,579
Okay.

456
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,950
You withdrew the boys...

457
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,490
without my permission?

458
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,559
They even brought the chief prosecutor to make us leave.

459
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,259
What other choice did we have?

460
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,798
"The chief prosecutor?"

461
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,130
That Song Yi Heon kid isn't your match.

462
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,369
So are you doing it or not?

463
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,309
I'm sure you made a deal with me at the hospital.

464
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,109
What are you talking about?

465
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,619
You can't do the surgery without the payment?

466
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,190
- Sir, you can't... - Let go!

467
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,788
I told you, our gang is falling apart,

468
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:06,660
so we don't have money for the surgery.

469
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,960
I will do whatever it takes to make the money after the surgery.

470
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,829
Our boss is the leader of the Chilsung Gang.

471
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,700
The Chilsung Gang doesn't die like this.

472
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:14,229
We don't!

473
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,700
Let go!

474
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,969
We're the Chilsung Gang! I won't let him go!

475
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,970
Let go!

476
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,279
Don't you need some work?

477
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,519
You look like you really need it.

478
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,880
You're so lucky.

479
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,089
As it happens, I needed a hunting dog.

480
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,329
Why don't you work with me?

481
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:45,599
What?

482
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,500
In return, I will give you your boss's surgery fee.

483
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,439
Are you saying that you will pay for my boss's surgery?

484
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,740
It's already been paid for.

485
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,339
They will begin the surgery in an hour.

486
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,680
If you don't feel like it, you can still cancel.

487
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:11,119
No, I'll do it.

488
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,660
When the surgery is over,

489
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,420
come to the Hyeonnam-dong Shin Hotel.

490
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,039
No.

491
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:29,640
I'll do it.

492
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:34,180
Sit down. I said, sit down.

493
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,108
If the kid keeps overturning the table,

494
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,549
then you should have taken him away from the table.

495
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,450
Don't you think?

496
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,160
That's if you want to protect your boys...

497
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,190
like you did your boss.

498
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,799
I will take care of what was overturned...

499
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,369
from the table.

500
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,339
Don't worry.

501
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:06,109
I will personally send him to a place with many accidents.

502
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,109
This is your last chance.

503
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,578
I'm only putting up with this because of all the money I spent.

504
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:14,619
Got it?

505
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,220
Or else I'll hand over all the buildings...

506
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,490
to the other guys.

507
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,930
Okay? Show some effort.

508
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:39,480
Gosh...

509
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:41,740
Her eyes...

510
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:43,910
Boss...

511
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,578
I was so worried that you would say you wouldn't do it...

512
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,390
since you told me to withdraw the boys.

513
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:50,749
I haven't made up my mind yet.

514
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,289
What? But...

515
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,889
you told that woman you would...

516
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,359
Song Yi Heon told me to bring that woman to him.

517
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,759
I let...

518
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,900
Song Yi Heon go.

519
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,400
To be exact,

520
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:09,970
I didn't stop him from leaving.

521
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
For some reason,

522
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,309
I couldn't stop him.

523
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,480
Gosh...

524
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:24,150
He knew things only Boss Deuk Pal could know.

525
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,859
Could he be Deuk Pal's...

526
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,259
son?

527
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:35,828
It's dangerous if he gets caught having family,

528
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:37,028
so maybe he hid away his son.

529
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:39,200
Why would it be dangerous to tell us?

530
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,970
Do you mean he thought we would betray him or something?

531
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,539
There's no way he would raise his guard against us.

532
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,210
- You're right. - That kid isn't his son.

533
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,579
- He's a swindler. - "Swindler?"

534
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,549
- Jong Cheol. - Yes, sir?

535
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,789
Get ready to tail Song Yi Heon.

536
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,660
I will go myself,

537
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,089
catch that swindler and turn him in to Lee Mi Kyung.

538
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,159
(Escape school violence, make friends)

539
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,200
(Make real family, protect Mother, get into university)

540
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:13,240
(Make friends)

541
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,140
I'm sure Dong Soo got it by now.

542
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,579
(Make real family, protect Mother)

543
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,029
Did you get home safe?

544
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,859
I realized that I forgot to say thanks.

545
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:42,430
For the phone and also the bodyguards.

546
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:46,200
And also for bringing your father. Thanks for everything.

547
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,309
Tomorrow is an off day. Are you coming to the study room?

548
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,029
(Choi Se Kyung, Are you coming to the study room? Are you sick?)

549
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,359
- Are you giving this to him? - I don't know.

550
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,769
- You're not? - I don't know.

551
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:19,839
Hurry!

552
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:27,410
Oh, thanks.

553
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,450
Is the student government president not here today?

554
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,779
Did you fight?

555
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,220
We didn't fight,

556
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,220
but I don't know why he's not coming.

557
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:38,420
I hope you make up soon. You're friends.

558
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,490
Come on.

559
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,740
I took care of the gang members in front of your house.

560
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,079
Let's go. It's very late.

561
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:18,090
Where are you?

562
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,329
Let's go on the swings.

563
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,650
Gosh...

564
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,610
Hey.

565
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,948
You look fine.

566
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,549
Why didn't you come to the study room...

567
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,690
or answer my texts?

568
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,460
Don't contact me anymore.

569
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,989
I changed my phone to a 2G phone.

570
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,760
And I won't be going to the study room, either.

571
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,230
I won't acknowledge you at school anymore.

572
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,510
Did your father tell you not to hang around with me?

573
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:07,409
I guess you really know everything except how to study.

574
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,650
I understand.

575
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,949
Gangsters keep coming to my house.

576
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,190
I don't blame him for wanting that as a parent.

577
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,320
It's not because of you.

578
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,920
It's all because of me.

579
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,130
Promise me, then.

580
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,829
That you'll never see Song Yi Heon again.

581
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,799
You won't go to school with him, let alone go to the study room.

582
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,969
You won't even talk to him.

583
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,769
Change your phone too.

584
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:34,570
To one that only lets you send texts.

585
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,538
I'll check it frequently.

586
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:37,539
Do you have to go that far?

587
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,679
His mother is an alcoholic, and his father has no presence.

588
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,940
And his score is...

589
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,949
Make some better friends.

590
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,848
No.

591
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,849
Ignore him completely. That's what you should do.

592
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,690
Okay.

593
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,130
Because of you...

594
00:35:58,389 --> 00:35:59,599
Just for you,

595
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:02,369
I have changed my schedule and lifestyle.

596
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:06,199
So you just need to do what I tell you.

597
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:09,309
This is all for your own good.

598
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,809
It's not because of you.

599
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,480
You did nothing wrong.

600
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:18,579
You couldn't call the police because I asked you not to.

601
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,619
So you had to bring your father to such a dangerous place.

602
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,420
It wasn't your fault.

603
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,789
I'll continue to help you with your study.

604
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,670
- Will that be okay? - Wait.

605
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,340
This is my mother's old tablet, and it has a number.

606
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,469
You can call me at this number.

607
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:54,679
For you,

608
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:58,190
Song Yi Heon's return is the most important.

609
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,429
I guess so.

610
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,699
I have to go now.

611
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:14,869
Okay.

612
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,539
Use me if you have to.

613
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:21,110
- "Use you?" - I'm better than you physically,

614
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,079
though I'm smart.

615
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,980
Do you know how to ride a bicycle?

616
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,789
Is there anyone who can't?

617
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,989
I can't.

618
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:33,960
No one has taught me.

619
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,559
Okay. I'll teach you how to ride it.

620
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,099
Anything else?

621
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,000
I also don't know how to drink alcohol.

622
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,439
Come on.

623
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,300
High school students aren't supposed to drink.

624
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,340
But you have.

625
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:54,840
You're right.

626
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:56,980
An adult should teach you how to drink.

627
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:04,018
When I was young, we drank while playing poker in our room...

628
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:05,519
behind our teachers' back when we were on a field trip.

629
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,960
I've never been on a field trip.

630
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,360
My father doesn't like me sleeping out,

631
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,030
so I can only do a one-day trip even with my friends.

632
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,159
By the way, how did you get out of your house this time?

633
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:17,130
My father likes Jae Hoon...

634
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:20,670
No, he likes Jae Hoon's family very much.

635
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,639
He told me to study with him right now.

636
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,079
I dropped by here on my way to the tutor.

637
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:30,309
- "Jae Hoon?" - The one with the basketball.

638
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,250
Why don't we make a math study group during the evening self-study?

639
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,719
Right.

640
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,289
That punk who requires more than social distancing.

641
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,488
(Hansong High School)

642
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,030
(College entrance information session)

643
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:06,179
He doesn't fail to look like a punk.

644
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,689
- Here. On the other side. - Block him.

645
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,690
- Here. - No!

646
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,119
- What? - Block him.

647
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,690
- What were you doing? Hey. - Yes!

648
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,929
You know Song Yi Heon has become a bully, right?

649
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,530
I heard he got in shape during the vacation.

650
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,869
That's why he plays basketball and soccer well now.

651
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,639
He got into Hong Jae Min's group after getting in shape.

652
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,078
Many saw them together.

653
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,380
They smoke cigarettes together too.

654
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,908
After getting beaten up repeatedly,

655
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,079
he chose to become one of them.

656
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,420
Hey, Jae Hoon.

657
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,630
How is it? Isn't it cool?

658
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,400
You should learn how to box too.

659
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,130
When you use your body and brain together,

660
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,440
the garbage-like thoughts in your head will vanish.

661
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,739
Did you just reach out to hit me?

662
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:08,808
Your fist touched my nose.

663
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:12,079
Hey. Why is Se Kyung hanging out with Jae Hoon?

664
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,679
Did you get in a fight with him?

665
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,289
It was a prank, right?

666
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,789
What are you, a child? Why are you asking that?

667
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,159
I heard Jae Hoon's grandfather is some sort of minister.

668
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,889
The son of a prosecutor with the highest score...

669
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,658
and the grandson of a minister with the second-highest score.

670
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:27,699
Goodness.

671
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,230
We, the ordinary, can't easily come between them, can we?

672
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,369
Come this way.

673
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,239
Hey. You should go in first.

674
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:45,250
- Where's the lighter? - Are you still smoking?

675
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,650
- Darn it. - Goodness.

676
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,960
Okay.

677
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:03,199
I told you not to be late to school.

678
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,799
There was traffic for the subway.

679
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
You should have left your house earlier, then.

680
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:08,869
Hey, where is Jae Min?

681
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,969
We came to find him too.

682
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,110
Why are you...

683
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:17,050
looking for him?

684
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:18,579
- Well, it's... - Jae Min?

685
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:20,279
I think he got his mind straight.

686
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,719
We wanted to see him during the weekend, but he didn't come.

687
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,089
We thought we'd see him once we came to school.

688
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,759
- That was what you meant, right? - Right.

689
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
That's right.

690
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:34,030
So are you going home because he didn't come to school?

691
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,730
- No. - That's not the case.

692
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:39,268
- No. - Should we go to class, then?

693
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:41,139
- Let's go. - Hurry up.

694
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,469
Is it time for PE? No, it's not.

695
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,489
Aren't you coming to school?

696
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,360
Do you want me to bury you?

697
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:05,859
It'll hurt more when I hit you later.

698
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,260
This is exciting.

699
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:08,900
Are you up for makeup?

700
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,570
We have our yearbook photoshoot at the park.

701
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:14,739
(Yearbook photoshoot and picnic at Hyeonnam Park)

702
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,638
- Is it tomorrow? - Yes.

703
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:17,840
Do you want to put on makeup?

704
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:20,510
Is a makeup artist coming for the yearbook photo?

705
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,710
Ye Ji's shop will be open!

706
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,610
Her mom owns a beauty salon.

707
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,650
She will lend us the glam tools tomorrow.

708
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,819
You can't perm or cut your hair.

709
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,218
But curling, attaching hair pieces, dying with the hair chalk,

710
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:31,989
and straightening are possible.

711
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,230
A handsome man needs no filters.

712
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,800
By the way, is that picnic the picnic I know of?

713
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,400
The one we had in our elementary school with the Towel Dropping?

714
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,239
I don't know about the Towel Dropping,

715
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,869
but it's a picnic.

716
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,840
- I think it's a picnic. - Yes.

717
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,550
Today, we have a photoshoot for the yearbook.

718
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:07,320
Ye Ji gave this to me. It's our matching items.

719
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:08,719
Guys, look over here.

720
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:10,760
- Hi. - What is it?

721
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,190
- It's my vlog. - Hello.

722
00:43:12,191 --> 00:43:14,428
- Ye Ji gave us this. - Aren't these cute?

723
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:17,070
- Mine is more cuter, right? - No.

724
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,599
I've prepared some stuff.

725
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,308
- What? - What are all these?

726
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:25,440
What are these?

727
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,139
I saw this in a museum.

728
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:30,550
Did you rob a museum?

729
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,078
Isn't this the rock...

730
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,218
used to build an underground shack in the New Stone Age?

731
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:35,250
- I've never seen it before. - Goodness.

732
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,820
- Nice. - Cool.

733
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,360
Look. I think they're playing games.

734
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,860
- Let's join them. - Let's go.

735
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,710
Okay, clap.

736
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,809
- Okay. It's Guess the Singer quiz! - Ta-da!

737
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:05,109
We'll play by teams.

738
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,819
Se Kyung, Chan Woo, and Dong Gyu are one team.

739
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,949
- You are Team Dong Gyu's Child. - Okay.

740
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,549
Yi Heon, Min Ji, and Yeon Ji are one team.

741
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,689
You're Team Pa Song Song, right?

742
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:13,719
- Right? - Team Pa Song Song.

743
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,760
Wait a second. Let me get ready.

744
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:19,900
Are you ready for the quiz that transcends time?

745
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:21,928
- My goodness. - I'm ready!

746
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:22,968
I can't see all of a sudden.

747
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,868
- You are unbelievable. - We're ready!

748
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:26,039
Okay. Here.

749
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:29,199
Guess the name of the singer after hearing the title of the song.

750
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,539
- We'll begin right away. - Okay.

751
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,578
- "Candy." - I got it. Team Dong Gyu's Child.

752
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:35,238
This team was faster this time.

753
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,078
Who sang "Candy?"

754
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:38,509
- It's by NCT. - Okay.

755
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:41,479
Incorrect! I wouldn't give out such an easy question.

756
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,749
Didn't I emphasize...

757
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,190
on "transcending time?"

758
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,019
- No, you're wrong. - What?

759
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,119
Who would have sung it besides NCT?

760
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,289
H.O.T?

761
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,900
What? Correct.

762
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,960
How did you know?

763
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,899
"H.O.T?" Who is "H.O.T?" Wasn't it by NCT?

764
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,539
Who is H.O.T?

765
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,839
What's with you? How did you know that?

766
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,739
This was supposed to be a tough question.

767
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:06,840
- Amazing. - Yi Heon, what's with you?

768
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:08,179
Cool.

769
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,110
Are you a dad or what?

770
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:13,650
You don't know anything.

771
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,650
- Give us the next one quickly. - In that case,

772
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,089
- "Dreams Come True." - Team Dong Gyu's Child.

773
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,158
Yes.

774
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:23,129
- aespa. - Incorrect.

775
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,190
What?

776
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:26,630
S.E.S.

777
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,829
- Yi Heon's correct. - Amazing.

778
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:32,030
- "Girls' Generation." - "Girls' Generation?"

779
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,570
- Girls' Generation is... - Girls' Generation is...

780
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,969
- Lee Seung Chul. - Correct.

781
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,210
Gosh.

782
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:38,969
Then...

783
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:41,940
"Pierrot Smiling at Us."

784
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,880
I... IU?

785
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,949
- Kim Wan Sun. - Correct.

786
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:54,288
Hold on. Which team is Yi Heon on?

787
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:56,230
How should we count the points?

788
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:58,429
- He was on our team from the start. - He's on our team.

789
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,799
- Team Pa Song Song. - Sir, please join us.

790
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,400
Hey, he's Team Pa Song Song.

791
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,440
Okay. Smile.

792
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,239
Hey, boy.

793
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:13,379
- You should smile. - Me?

794
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,010
You shouldn't frown like that. You should smile.

795
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,380
Give me a smile. Yes.

796
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,980
Everyone, give me a big smile.

797
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:22,449
This time, make a V sign.

798
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,320
A V sign.

799
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:27,019
This time, put your thumb up.

800
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,229
Last, give me a finger heart.

801
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:31,260
The finger heart.

802
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:33,760
Yi Heon, you have to put your fingers closer together.

803
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,928
Your fingers look weird.

804
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:37,699
Put the fingers closer together.

805
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,739
This way. Can't you do it?

806
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:41,170
Forget about it if you can't do it.

807
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,469
Just strike a pose that is the most comfortable for you.

808
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:45,768
Here we go.

809
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,210
One, two...

810
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,809
I've seen such a scene before.

811
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:53,749
Me too. Right. I saw it in the society section of a newspaper.

812
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,078
It was a photo of gangsters.

813
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,218
One last time.

814
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:58,289
One, two.

815
00:46:58,489 --> 00:47:00,419
Is there anyone around you...

816
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,729
who is a great fighter and is righteous,

817
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,400
but doesn't know our slang or games...

818
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,199
while speaking old idioms in honorifics?

819
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,070
Anyone?

820
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,969
Are you talking about Yi Heon?

821
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,610
Well.

822
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:20,908
I had a transfer student from the mountains...

823
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:22,409
who only used to live with his grandfather.

824
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:25,308
He didn't know our slang or songs that well.

825
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,349
He didn't know games, either.

826
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,549
Right. He didn't know how strong he was,

827
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,719
so he kept winning arm-wrestling matches.

828
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,920
I see.

829
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,489
Does Yi Heon have a similar case?

830
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,429
We didn't really know him during our sophomore and junior years.

831
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,489
If he went to a school in the countryside,

832
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:39,760
he could be like that.

833
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,829
I think he is hot because he's pure.

834
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:45,599
Okay. Good job.

835
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,869
Yes. Nicely done.

836
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:53,510
They came to take the photo for the yearbook.

837
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,110
What about Jae Min? Have you seen him?

838
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,849
The students from another class just told me...

839
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,590
that Jae Min works at a convenience store in Changsin-dong.

840
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:06,920
He told them never to tell anyone.

841
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,629
Hey, will you move to the side a little?

842
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,260
Okay. That's enough. Good.

843
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,428
Smile.

844
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:13,929
That idiot.

845
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,340
Do you work part-time at a convenience store?

846
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:23,469
If you don't answer me,

847
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,539
I'll go there so that you won't be able to work.

848
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,880
What kind of situation are you in?

849
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,379
Jang Byung Chul and Park Duk Jun. Those punks.

850
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,479
They are chasing me to hand me over to the Dongsoo Gang.

851
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,749
I got fired from the part-time job I had before.

852
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,118
I haven't been able to go home.

853
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,289
How can I go to school in this situation?

854
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,059
If I do, they'll drag me to the gang right away.

855
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:42,260
But you're no use to them.

856
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:47,659
There's an underboss named Han Jong Cheol.

857
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,130
He said he'd set an example with me...

858
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:52,369
to show what would happen if one runs away during a job.

859
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:59,509
I mean, you should have done such a thing from the beginning.

860
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:00,840
They're gangsters.

861
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,710
They are way scarier than getting beaten by you.

862
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:07,420
Whatever. I'm going to quit school, so don't come here.

863
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:09,949
How can you quit school when I haven't forgiven you?

864
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,420
Come to school. I'll handle the problem.

865
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,230
- How can you handle it? - I have my ways.

866
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:20,630
If you don't come to school,

867
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,130
you'll never be able to work part-time again.

868
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:31,139
(Choi Se Kyung)

869
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,489
Where are you?

870
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,119
It's higher than I thought.

871
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:51,289
When Yi Heon jumped off from here, do you think it hurt?

872
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,429
Hey.

873
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,530
Are you okay?

874
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,030
When I left home,

875
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,070
I thought I could kill myself.

876
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,969
How did you know this was the site of Yi Heon's accident?

877
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,980
I searched the news online.

878
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:48,780
Can I sleep over at your place...

879
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,250
just for today?

880
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:57,690
On a day like this, you don't want to go home.

881
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:02,999
Let's go.

882
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,469
This pedestrian overpass has a bad vibe.

883
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:12,969
To where?

884
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,380
To do something you haven't done before.

885
00:52:04,929 --> 00:52:06,129
Stay on your toes.

886
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:09,030
Our goal is to follow him quietly, capture him at the right moment,

887
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,070
and put him on an airplane.

888
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:12,929
Except for the times I study,

889
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,299
I only think about how to get away from my father.

890
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,339
I think I'm becoming insane.

891
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,539
You should've come to us...

892
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,880
and told us that you were Boss Deuk Pal's son.

893
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,618
I know it too! To be abused and take a beating.

894
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:28,979
He lured my son Choi Se Kyung in the same class...

895
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,348
to stay out overnight.

896
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:33,218
I have statements that say he has been harassing...

897
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:34,489
his classmates continuously.

898
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:38,729
I believe he needs to face proper disciplinary action.

899
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,530
So I suggest we hold a school violence committee.
